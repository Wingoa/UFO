        The Sun has reported a <event>UFO sighting</event> over <eventLocation eloc ="Temhill_Barracks">Temhill Barracks</eventLocation> in <location loc="Shropshire">Shropshire</location> at about 11pm on <eventDate date="06/07/2008">7 June 2008</eventDate>. It
        appears that a number of soldiers saw lights in the sky and made a video which they have passed to the
        newspaper. They have not made a formal written report on the matter, although they did inform their
        superiors.
        
        The <organization org= "MoD">MoD</organization> in <location loc="London">London</location> became involved when the press office was contacted by the newspaper on 24th June.
        On 25th June I requested a copy of the video from Media Ops at HQ 5 Div where it had been passed by the
        unit concerned. It shows a number of lights in the sky. As reported in the paper, <lightDesc>the lights change colour and
        appear square, but this looks like the pixels snag up as the photographer zoomed in. They do not appear
        to be moving vary quickly</lightDesc>.
        
        The BBC has reported that at the same time as the alleged incident, a Iocal hotel was jefting off Chinese
        lanterns and, apparently, the hotel manager thinks the whole UFO story is “highly hilarious”.
        
        I do not intend to investigate any further as I think we have our answer and, as I suspect there might be
        copyright issues surrounding the video, do not intend to retain a copy on our files.
        
        I will inform the soldiers of my decision through their 2ic.
