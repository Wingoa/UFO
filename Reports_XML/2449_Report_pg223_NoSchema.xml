        We spoke, but the following is the basic story:
        
        I took a call this morning from the 2IC rear part at 1 Royal Irish at Tern Hill Capt[] on []
        
        A soldier who was part of a fire picket stagging on at the camp on <eventDate date="06/07/2008">7 June</eventDate> took 
        video footage with a camera on a mobile phone of what he says were <event>"UFOs"
            in the sky above the camp</event> - which they have emailed to The Sun - and which 
        The Sun is apparently planning on splashing - probably tomorrow.
        
        I don't have all the details/timings but what I do have is the following:
        
        1. Soldier is Cpl [] who the phone belongs to- he was 
           accompanied by Pte [] who also witnessed the "UFOs".
           2. The footage was taken on <eventDate date="06/07/2008">7 June at 23.03 hrs,</eventDate> - with a 5 megapixel
           camera on the phone.
        3. 2IC rear party says the video images are very good.
        4. The 2IC says the images could not have been anything to do with
        nearby <location loc="RAF_Shawbury">RAF Shawbury</location>.
        5. They show lots of <shipDesc>multi-coloured dots and zoom in on a cube shaped
            object which then flattens</shipDesc>.
        6. The Sun has already interviewed Cpl [] - he has explained to
           them what he saw.
        7. There is some suggestion of payment being offered - thought I think a 
           discussion about that has still to happen.
        8. I have reminded all, the 2IC and Cpl [] about their responsibilities
           ref the DIN on communicating with the media.
        9. Cpl [] spoke to [] an editor at The Sun (?)
        10.Cpl [] mobile number is []
        11.I spoke to the CRO at <location loc="RAF_Shawbury">RAF Shawbury</location> who said he was not aware -
