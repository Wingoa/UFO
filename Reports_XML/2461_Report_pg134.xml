    <body>I would like to explain what I saw on the night of Saturday 9th May 2009 over []
            <eventLocation eloc="Ariow_Essex">ariow Essex</eventLocation>[] A <ufoDesc>diamond
            shaped orange light</ufoDesc> was above me which was also witnessed by my 7 year old
        son. <ufoDesc>It certainly was not a plane</ufoDesc> as these could be <ufoDesc>seen clearly
            at a greater height and all flashing lights</ufoDesc> could be seen on those.
            <event>Above us (if you were to hold out your hand) it would have been the size of a 20
            pence piece</event>. <ufoDesc>The object was almost silent</ufoDesc> as this was
            <weather>around 10pm</weather>, and carried on its path into the distance. I went to
        call my partner and at the same time was talking to my son about what we had both seen and
        in the same place another orange object appeared and travelled in the same direction, again,
            <ufoDesc>no flashing lights or obvious shape and also almost silent</ufoDesc>. <event>I
            waited for almost 20 minutes trying to convince myself it may have been the route of
            planes, but nothing else was seen</event>. <event>I managed to take a picture of the
            iphone</event> which I have attached for you to view. The pictures are a little small,
        but I hope they can be of some help.</body>
    <signature>Any feedback would be great if its possible. Thanks in advance []</signature>
