    <address> Hi,</address>
    <body><event>I'm not sure that these were UFOs</event>, but last night on <eventDate date="02/02/2009">7
            February 2009</eventDate> I saw <ufoDesc>2 strange lights in the sky</ufoDesc> over
            <eventLocation eloc="Basingstoke_Hampshire">Basingstoke in Hampshire</eventLocation>. At
            <weather>11:1Opm</weather> my partner and I noticed a very <ufoDesc> bright orange light
            travelling very fast</ufoDesc> from North to South East. <ufoDesc>It was too large and
            bright to be a plane</ufoDesc>, <ufoDesc>it was in view for approx 1 minute then
            disappeared behind a cloud</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>We could notice no noise or
            tail</ufoDesc>. At <weather>12:10am</weather> on 8 February I noticed what appeared to
        be an <ufoDesc>extremely bright</ufoDesc>, <ufoDesc>white star</ufoDesc>, where the
            <ufoDesc>orange light</ufoDesc> had originated. <ufoDesc>The star seemed to fall out of
            the sky, towards the ground very quickly</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>It disappeared within
            seconds</ufoDesc>. If you happen to know what these lights were and could let me know, I
        would appreciate it.</body>
