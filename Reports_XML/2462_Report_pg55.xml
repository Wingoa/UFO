    <body>Last <weather>night</weather> at <weather>around 10.30pm</weather> my husband and I
        watched in the sky <ufoDesc>9 bright orange circular shapes glide across the night sky</ufoDesc>. <event>They seemed
        to be travelling at a speed similar to that of an aircraft</event>. At first I thought it was an
        <eventName>aeroplane with a different colour</eventName>ed light ( we live on a flight path for <organization org="ManAir">Manchester
        Airport</organization>), but then one after the other more and <event>more lights came into view</event>. Then I thought
        it was fireworks, but they don't last that long, and <ufoDesc>don't move like these lights did</ufoDesc>. <event>It
        lasted for a couple of mins</event>. I went outside and saw a neighbour who was out walking her dog,
        and she was as stunned as I was. Have there been any more reports made? <eventDate date="08/01/2009">Sat 1st Aug 2009</eventDate>.
