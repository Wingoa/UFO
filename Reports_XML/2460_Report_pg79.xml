<report id="2460_pg79">
    <body>Anyway, with reference to what I saw on my trip to <eventName>Gatwick on
            Monday</eventName>
        <eventDate date="09/01/2008">1st September 2008</eventDate>, here is my account of what took
        place. <event>I was en route to collect my neighbour's wife and children from her return
            trip from Toronto</event>. Her time of arrival was <weather>11am</weather>, I was
        advised by my neighbour that I should plan to be there about 11.30am, although I wanted to
        be a little earlier on arrival for parking and a coffee, but found myself running late after
        getting to grips with a new Satellite Navigation system and moments of slow motorway
        traffic. At about 11.05am I was still travelling south, somewhere from the M25 to the M23. I
        would have to provide a 'guesstimate' of my rough location after tracing my route and being
        some 20-25 mlnutes away from <eventLocation eloc="Gatwick">Gatwick Airport</eventLocation>
        Itself and on the M23 southbound. Because I was working with a brand new Sat Nav system I
        could not immediately Identify my spot location from the map vlew (I had a Navman which was
        in a planned route mode and gave a limited vlew of where I was). But I think I was on the
        M23 not too far from the M25 junction. <weather>It was raining to some degree</weather>, I
        had my windscreen wipers operated and car windscreen was clean and without mist with car
        air-con functional (I drive a Volvo V70). I was in the central lane paying attention to
        driving hazards and traffic progression (this being skills learnt from the Institute
        Advanced Motorists standards and police driving standards), basically scanning from horizon
        to car bonnet and back to horizon taking into account all traffic and it's local
        environment. times I would glance in to the sky to try to get vlew of flights in bound to
        Gatwick and an idea of my closeness to destination. It was at this point soon after I saw
            <ufoDesc>a flash and bright light in the sky</ufoDesc> and Immediately associated it
        with a plane or helicopter (where I live in Waltham Abbey gives a regular view of commercial
        type flights and helicopter flights as a Met police helicopter landing site is near my house
        about 1 mile. I walted to identify either a jet plane or helicopter. <ufoDesc>The bright
            light stopped</ufoDesc> and (I expected to see the plane or helicopter) allowed a side
        profile to be viewed as <ufoDesc>the air-borne vehicle travelled from left to
            right</ufoDesc>. At all times I continued to have casual peripheral vision on the
        motorway traffic which was continuous and regular. I continued to watch the sky not thinking
        anything unusual and then this <ufoDesc>oval shaped object</ufoDesc> (I now realise it could
        only match a helicopter in <ufoDesc>it's side profile was missing it's rear tail</ufoDesc>),
            <ufoDesc>accelerated at a colossal speed, faster than any aircraft I have or been aware
            of</ufoDesc> accelerating before and base this on attending airshows a s a child and
        even seelng jet fighters fly over my junlor school when a child in Loughton, Essex on the
        1970's which included the sound boom. <ufoDesc>This unusual oval shaped Ariel vehicle, after
            accelerating, just vanished out of view.</ufoDesc>
        <ufoDesc>it was quite small in size</ufoDesc> and appeared to be below cloud cover, but I
        cannot say categorically. Until It disappeared it was constant and visible and perhaps 1mile
        away, but this is hard to say. Overall, <event>this incident lasted for about 5- 10
            seconds</event>. Once it had disappeared, I had limited time to re-assess it's location
        as my road position changed and meant I had to look to my right and through my driver's door
        window. I have not reported this to <organization org="MOD">MOD</organization>, for a
        limited information feedback reason, I have been aware of such matters in the past as I have
        pald casual attention to this interest since the mid 1990's (during my time in the
            <organization org="MET">Met Police</organization>) and relevant book releases and
        programmes.</body>
    <signature>I would be happy to discuss this further if necessary. Regards, </signature>
