    <head>To: Subject: Air CmdSecCS-UFO Desk Report - <eventName>Strange Lights in the
            Sky</eventName></head>
    <body><ufoDesc>I suspect they were meteors</ufoDesc> (do not believe in ET!), however, my
        Husband, two young children and I all clearly witnessed some <ufoDesc>very strange lights in
            the sky</ufoDesc> over <eventLocation eloc="Farleigh"
            >Farleigh/Warlingham</eventLocation>, Surrey last <weather>night</weather>, (<eventDate
            date="03/01/2008">Sunday lst March</eventDate>) at <weather>approximately 7pm</weather>.
        We were driving home from Selsdon, Surrey, and heading up Farleigh Road towards Warlingham
        when we spotted <ufoDesc>three very bright orange lights</ufoDesc> in the sky. <ufoDesc>They
            appeared circular, with no tail</ufoDesc> that was visible, and were travelling at speed
        towards the East (approx). <ufoDesc>They were visible for a good 4-5 minutes very
            brightly</ufoDesc>, at which pointed they slowly faded and disappeard one by one. I saw
        one on it's own first off, which appeared to be just above the tree line ahead, and thought
        it looked like an <ufoDesc>orange street lamp</ufoDesc>, but realised that as we rounded the
        corner there were two others - <ufoDesc>they were all high in the sky and together they
            appeard to be in a triangular formation to start</ufoDesc>. We pulled over in the
        entrance to Farleigh Golf Club and watched as they flew over our head before dissapearing.
            <ufoDesc>They made no noise</ufoDesc>, and we could not tell how high they were. Someone
        pulled over behind us, pressumably to watch too, however, we did not speak to them. Would
        love to know if these <ufoDesc>lights</ufoDesc> have been reported by anyone else and if
        anyone would know what it was we saw. Why do we never have a camera when we really need one! </body>
    <signature>A response would be much appreciated. Many thanks []</signature>
