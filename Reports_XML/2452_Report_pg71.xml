    <head><eventName>UFO in Samaria Sky</eventName></head>

    <body>This is an object that appeared South-East to <eventLocation eloc="KfarSaba_Israel"
            >Kfar-Saba, Israel</eventLocation>, on <eventDate date="08/12/2009" toc="20090812">Aug-12,
            2009</eventDate>, circ <weather>9-10pm</weather>. Most of time there were <ufoDesc>more
            than one there</ufoDesc>, usually a pair of them <ufoDesc>appearing one after another in
            a distance and difference of heights</ufoDesc> b/w 'em. <ufoDesc>hanging in one point
            still for minutes, then disappearing momentarily</ufoDesc>. One time <ufoDesc>a
            'triangle' formation of near a dozen of those appeared</ufoDesc> as well, with one of
        them hanging <event>aside off the triangle</event> ('the admiral ship'). Unfortunately,
            <event>I was busy looking for fresh batteries for my camera and this was the only sample
            capture I was able to take until the camera died</event>. <ufoDesc>The object was
            perfectly still</ufoDesc>, all the movements while zoomed-in are due to my hands'
        shaking. Please comment if you have something smart to contribute to enlightening the
        phenomena.</body>
