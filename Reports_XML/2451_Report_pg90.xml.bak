    <address>Dear Sir,</address>
    
    <body>
        
        <eventName>Sighting of same UFO type on two continents</eventName>.
        
       I want to impress you first with my qualifications for knowing 
       what I saw and secondly for being able to identify that what 
       I saw was not a normal aerial object.
       
       For some twenty five years I was in the <organization org="British_Army">Army of Great Britain</organization>
       and <organization org="Australian_Army">Australia</organization> as a National Serviceman and then as a Territorial
       Army and Citizens' Military Force Volunteer. My final rank was 
       Captain. In the <organization org="British_Army">British Army</organization>, my number was [] and my main 
       occupation waws Forward Observer in Field Artillery but <event>I also 
       served in a light Anti-aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery
       where you served by identification of enemy aircraft in time
       to take proper action</event>. <event>For more than twenty-five years I studied
       aircraft recognition as a civilian amateur and as a military
       professional.</event>
       
       From the foregoing I hope that you may realise that I have
       been trained, have experience and are able to dentify objects,
       their shape and dimensions at a distance. It may be considered
       that if I say that I saw something and describe it in detail
       I did see it and that it did exist at two separate times in
       separate places on two continents.
       
       Early in <eventDate date="??/??/2007">2007</eventDate>, I cannot give you the exact date because that
       did not become important until my second sighting, one morning
       I was in my front garden in <location loc="Hawthorn">Hawthorn</location>, an inner suburb of
       <eventLocation eloc="Melbourne_Australia">Melbourne, Australia</eventLocation>. I heard a large jet aeroplane approaching
       from the east at low level and recognised the sound of a Boeing
       747. I got hold of my binoculars, which I keep handy for such
       occasions, captured the image and followed the plane as it passed
       slowly from east to west across my front. It was to my north 
       about 1,000 metres from me at as low a level as such planes
       are permitted to fly across the inner areas of <location loc="Melbourne">Melbourne</location>, on
       a line of sight about fifteen degrees of elevation from me,
       in its sweeping approach to Tullamarine airport gone fifteen
       kilometres away. The sky was <weather>clear cloudless blue</weather>. 
       
       As I scanned back along the fuselage to the white kangaroo
       on the red tail of the Qadtas jumbo I saw behind and beyond
       the tail by at least 500 metres an <ufoDesc>object in the sky</ufoDesc>. I recall
       thinking I'll follow the 747 until it goes behind the nearby
       houses and then come back to the object. It was an <ufoDesc>unusual shape</ufoDesc>.
       
       The other day I heard a news broadcast which mentioned the 
       UFO desk at <organization org="MoD">MOD</organization> in <location loc="London">London</location> and as a result I have directed my report to you.
       
       If you require any other information, please let me know,
       otherwise, I do not expect you to expend your valuable time on 
       a reply.
