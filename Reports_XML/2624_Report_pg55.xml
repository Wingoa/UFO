        Hi, i would like to report a sighting of a flying saucer i've seen.  
        On the <eventDate date="08/15/2008">15/08/08</eventDate> at <weather>9:10pm</weather> while riding home on my motorcycle, i spotted <ufoDesc>three bright orange
        lights</ufoDesc> in the sky about a mile away, i pulled over to look and noticed that the lights were
        heading towards me. <event>The lights switched off one by one</event> but i could still see one of the objects, i
        lost sight of the other two, this object was <ufoDesc>black and disc shaped, it also moved quick and was
        silent.</ufoDesc>
        
        My location -<eventLocation eloc="Argoed"> Argoed South Wales</eventLocation>. 
        The lights were first spotted south of me near <eventLocation eloc="Blackwood">Blackwood</eventLocation> and one saucer was observed heading
        north.
        The saucer was in clear view over head at one point.
        I've also been told that there was a sighting about the same in <location loc="Bargoed">Bargoed</location>.</body>
