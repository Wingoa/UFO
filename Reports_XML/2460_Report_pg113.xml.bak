    <head><eventName>UFO sighting – Derbyshire</eventName></head>
    <address>Hi,</address>

    <body>I'm sure you must get so many reports of UFOs, but I thought you might be interested in my
        experience tonight I can't quite believe what I saw tonight, but it made me rush out onto
        the street camera in hand. I was very sober when I saw what I am about to describe. Until
        recently I was a journalist and we used to get similar stories like this from time to time
        which we would all have a good laugh at (not any more!) I was sitting on the couch when I
        saw an <ufoDesc>orange light in the sky</ufoDesc>. <event>My initial thoughts were 'that
            plane is flying low· and I went back to watching TV</event>. However, five/ten minutes
        or so later I couldn't believe it when I saw <ufoDesc>several orange lights</ufoDesc> -
            <ufoDesc>about the same colour and brightness of street lights</ufoDesc> -
            <ufoDesc>about half a dozen in total</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>Three of them were closer
            together than the others and were in a straight, but horizontal line.</ufoDesc>
        <event>I shouted upstairs to my boyfriend, who also witnessed the incident.</event> I then
        told him I was getting the camera before running outside -with no shoes on (the neighbours
        must think I'm mad). Unfortunately my camera is not great, but I have attached the pictures
        anyway in the hope you can enhance them. On the one marked UFO 001 you can see <ufoDesc>a
            round shape</ufoDesc>, which was not visible to the naked eye and only appeared when I
        blew up the photo. I believe it may show the <ufoDesc>three lights in a horizontal
            line</ufoDesc> I described earlier. <event>The whole incident could have only happened
            over a couple of minutes, maybe less.</event> The lights seemed to fade away, except one
        which I saw go behind some houses and I followed it a short way down the street on foot
        before it also disappeared. The incident happened around <weather>9:20pm</weather> today
            (<eventDate date="04/11/2009">Saturday 11 April. 2009</eventDate>). I live in a village
        called which is in <eventLocation eloc="Chesterfield_Derbyshire">Chesterfield,
            Derbyshire</eventLocation>. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else saw what I
        have described and if any explanation can be given.</body>
