    <body>[] Just to confirm as requested our conversation of this afternoon. [] of Wroughton (Tel
        No: [] ) telephoned the <organization org="RAF">RAF</organization> Lyneham ATC Supervisor on
        Monday, 15 Jun 09 to ask whether we had had any <ufoDesc>unusual aircraft</ufoDesc> in the
        vicinity of <eventLocation eloc="Wroughton">Wroughton</eventLocation>
        <weather>between 1930 and 200hrs</weather> (local) the previous evening (14 Jun 09). I told
        him that nothing had been seen by the Lyneham controllers and we had had no reports of
        anything unusual. He told me that he had seen <ufoDesc>black, disc-shaped objects</ufoDesc>,
            <ufoDesc>50ft in diameter</ufoDesc> with <ufoDesc>lights shining from beneath</ufoDesc>
        <ufoDesc>them hovering over crop circles</ufoDesc> near Barbury Castle (near Wroughton, just
        south of Junction 15 of the M4). T<ufoDesc>he discs cast shadows beneath them</ufoDesc> and
            <event>were captured on two separate video cameras</event>. He asked me to let him know
        if we discovered anything about the objects.</body>
    <signature>I hope that this is of interest to you. Regards []</signature>
