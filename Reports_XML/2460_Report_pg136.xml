    <body><eventDate date="03/27/2009">Friday 27-03-09</eventDate>at about <weather>4:1Opm</weather>
        in <eventLocation eloc="Walthamstow_London">Walthamstow London</eventLocation>, Driving home
        from work I had a sighting. At first I fought I saw <ufoDesc>three white birds circling in
            the sky</ufoDesc>. I soon realised that these were not birds as they were to
            <ufoDesc>far away and large</ufoDesc>. As they circled <ufoDesc>they were dipping in and
            out of the clouds</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>These objects were to fast to be aeroplanes and
            continued circling</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>they could have been a light sources or they
            could have been reflecting light</ufoDesc>. Cannot remember exact shape as all happened
        to quickly. Possible <ufoDesc> small tail of light underneath each one at a slight angle
            away from the direction of the objects travel</ufoDesc>. My sighting was breath as I
        turned a corner and drove through a built up area hoping to catch a glimpse later on my
        journey but this was not to be. I should have stopped the car to get a better look. Any idea
        what I might have seen? Have you received any other reports that might tie in with this
        sighting in terms of time or location.</body>
