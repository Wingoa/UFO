        Desk Subject: <eventName>Sighting over Winwick</eventName></head>
    <body>During the <weather>early hours</weather> of 15 February 2009 at around
            <weather>00:15hrs</weather> i was with my wife and two friends driving through
            <eventLocation eloc="Winwick_Warrington">Winwick Warrington</eventLocation>. I was
        driving and sighted <ufoDesc>two orange lights in the sky</ufoDesc> which was
            <ufoDesc>hovering over the old hospital</ufoDesc> sight that is now a housing
        development. <ufoDesc>The lights were not together but were stationary</ufoDesc>. <event>We stopped
        the car and got out to have a look</event>. <event>As we did we saw other people in nearby houses also
        stood looking at them</event>. <ufoDesc>There was no noise from them at all</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>One
            then began moving and moved away out of sight</ufoDesc> in a southern direction.
            <ufoDesc>The second light stayed in placed and then after around 30 seconds also moved
            away</ufoDesc> in the same direction. Again <ufoDesc>there was no noise</ufoDesc>.
            <ufoDesc>It was out of sight within around 15 seconds</ufoDesc>. <event>There was definitely
        something strange about it I am not a real believer in ufos but there is no other
        explanation</event>. </body>
