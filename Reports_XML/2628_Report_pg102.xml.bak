    <body>This photograph was taken by myself on <eventDate date="08/27/2006">Sunday the 27th of
            August 2006</eventDate>, in the Trough of <eventLocation eloc="Bowland_Lancashire"
            >Bowland, Lancashire</eventLocation> about 3 miles from <eventName>Dunsop
            Drickie</eventName> traveling towards Lancaster and captured <ufoDesc>something flying
            in the sky</ufoDesc> above a grassy ridge. I was using a canon 7-million-pixel digital
        camera. I saw the <ufoDesc>craft hovering for a few minutes</ufoDesc> and was able to take
        this snap. Whlist waiting for the camera to a cock itself for the next frame, <ufoDesc>the
            craft took off vertically at an amazing velocity</ufoDesc>. <weather>The craft, however,
            was unfortunately in the shadow of a cloud and cannot be seer to cast a
        shadow</weather>. I<event> have submitted this photograph to many newspapers and ufo
            groups</event>, but have only ever received one reply that said "very interesting" I
        hope that this photo may â€˜interest you'</body>
