Dear XXX.
As you know, OSI has completed a report on the landing of a craft of unknown origin
crewed by several entities near RAF Bentwaters on the night of the December 29/30
1980.
Interestingly. OS reports that the entities were approximately I â…— meters tall, wearing
what appeared to be nylon costed pressure suits, but no belmets. Conditions on the night
were misty, giving the appearance that the entities were hovering above ground level.
Tape recordings were made on which the entities are heard to speak in an electronically
synthesised version of English, with a strong American accent. Similar transmissions
intercepted irregularly by ISA (7) since 1973 (see attachment - Flag 1).
According to SI, entities had claw-like hands and with three fingers and an opposable
thumb.
Despite original reports (Flags 3 - 0), OSI said the craft was not damaged but landed
deliberately as part of a scries of visits to SAC bases in USA and Europe. Reports that
craft was repaired by US serviceman or was taken on to the base are not confirmed by
OSI

plans for counter-information at a local level involving XXX and a XXX XXX XXX is
strongly recommended.
Sincerely
