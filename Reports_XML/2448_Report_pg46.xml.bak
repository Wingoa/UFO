    <address> DearXXX, </address>

    <body> 
        
        As you know, <organization org="OSI">OSI</organization> has completed a report on the <event>
        landing of a craft of unknown origin crewed by several entities</event> near 
        <eventLocation eloc ="Raf_Bentwaters">RAF Bentwaters</eventLocation> on the night of the 
        <eventDate date="12/29/1980">December 29/30 1980</eventDate>.
        Interestingly, <organization org="OSI">OSI</organization> reports that the 
        <alienDesc>entities were approximately 1 Â½ meters tall, wearing what appeared to be nylon coated pressure suits, but no helmets</alienDesc>. <weather>Conditions on the night
        were misty</weather>, giving the appearance that the entities were hovering above ground level. Tape
        recordings were made on which the entities are heard to speak in an electronically
        synthesised version of English, with a strong American accent. Similar transmissions
        intercepted irregularly by ISA(?) since 1973(see attachment- Flag 1). According to <organization org="OSI">OSI</organization>,
        <alienDesc>entities had claw-like hands and with three fingers and an opposable thumb</alienDesc>. Despite original
        reports(Flags 3- 0), <organization org="OSI">OSI</organization> said the craft was not damaged but landed deliberately as part of a
        series of visits to SAC bases in USA and Europe. Reports that craft was repaired by US
        serviceman or was taken on to the base are not confirmed by <organization org="OSI">OSI</organization>. <event>Landing is not considered a
        defence issue in view of the overt peaceful nature of the contact</event>, but investigations byXXX
        are to be continued onXXX authority. Precautionary plans for counter-information at a local
        level involvingXXX and aXXXXXXXXX is strongly recommended.
