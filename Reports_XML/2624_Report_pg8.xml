    <body>request: Me and a friend were heading up the A19 north bound, going just past
        <eventLocation eloc="Borrowby">borrowby</eventLocation> between mt grace, I noticed some <event><ufoDesc>bright green lights with a blue light</ufoDesc> moving
        very quickly through the trees</event> and once we came past the trees the craft cut across
        the motoway in what can only be described as a <ufoDesc>very unusual large and silent craft</ufoDesc>
        moving very fast wich then <event>changed direction and headed towards the back of the car
        and shot out of site very quickly</event>. I have seen low flying fighter jets before and i
        know they have quite a loud distinct noise and shape when flying. The craft that we
        saw was <ufoDesc>silent, moving extremely fast, very large and had multiple bright lights</ufoDesc> on it
        not to mention its unusual shape.</body> 
        <signature>Please if you can shed some light on the matter and
        did have low flying air crafts in this area iet me know as i thought we were both
        going mad.</signature>
