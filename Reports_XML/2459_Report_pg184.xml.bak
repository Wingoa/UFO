    <address>Enquiry:</address>
    <body>I hope that you can help as this isn't a complaint. Like many others my husband and I saw
        <ufoDesc>strange objects flying</ufoDesc> in the <eventName>south side of glasgow</eventName>. We were driving on <eventLocation eloc="Cathcart_Road_Glasgow">Cathcart Road in
        Glasgow</eventLocation> (think G44 postcode) heading towards the city centre. To our left were what we
        counted as <ufoDesc>6 objects, in what to the eye was a static formation</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>Two lines of 3 sitting side
        by side, one line a little higher than the other</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>One oject above the other</ufoDesc>. <event>We turned off
        the main road to park the car and take photographs</event>. <event>They were now in front of us and we were
        facing west. We have never in our lives seen objects in the sky like this</event>. L<event>uckily we pulled
        over where other members of the public had pulled over, along with dog walkers who had
        congregated in amazement</event>. without managing to take a photo the objects seemed to start
        moving further away, drawing themselves together to make themselves look like one object and
        <ufoDesc>it/they it disappeared into the distance</ufoDesc> heading towards the west. <ufoDesc>At first quick glance
        they looked like they could have been helicopters but they definately weren't</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>The light
        that they emitted was very strong and surrounded each object in full</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>It was a
        yellow/orange</ufoDesc>. The whole sight was so extrodinary that after talking about it for hours we
        began to doubt ourselves. <event>This is why we're so very glad to have met with other members of
        the public so that our doubts couldn't be varified</event>. We began to reason that the evert would
        be in the local news as some sort of Christmas hoax but unfortunatelv we've not heard of
        anything apart from sightings on the 30th <weather>December</weather> about 20 minutes away by car! We would be
        most very thankful if you could inform us as to what these could have</body>
    <signature>Many thanks and kind regards,[]</signature>
