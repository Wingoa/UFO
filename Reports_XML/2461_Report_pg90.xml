    <body><eventLocation eloc="Winsford_Cheshire">In Winsford Cheshire</eventLocation> at
            <weather>approx 23:00 hrs</weather> we noticed <ufoDesc>an orange light which travelled
            over our house</ufoDesc> from the south. <event>This was not the normal flight
            path</event> we see for aircraft going into Manchester airport. <ufoDesc>It was then
            followed by 2 more orange lights on the same path</ufoDesc>. This made me go outside to
        see yet there was <ufoDesc>no noise for a craft which was only at an altitude of a helicopter</ufoDesc>. <event>A few
        seconds later 5 more objects appeared then another 2</event>. <event>I took pictures of the objects passing
        over</event> but <ufoDesc>there was no noise and they then eventually gained height and all disappeared</ufoDesc>
        north. Do you have any details of activity in our area which would explain this
        sighting.</body>
