        Subject: Just saw something amazing.
    </head>

    <body>
        I'm not a UFO person, doesn't really interest me in the slightest. I don't either believe that it 
        could be possible. But I was upstairs in my room (I'm 17), and my mom called me down.  We 
        were both amazed to see something in the sky. I live in <eventLocation eloc="Great_Barr">Great Barr, Birmingham, UK</eventLocation>. I know 
        for a fact that we couldn't have been the only people to have saw the thing in the sky. It was 
        <ufoDesc>insanely bright</ufoDesc>, so bright it hurt my eyes, and so bright that it could be seen for 5 minutes after 
        it has passed overhead. There was also an aeroplane in the sky at the same time, I'd put 
        money on them seeing it.
        
        It happened like 5 minutes ago, the only way i could describe it, is as being a <ufoDesc>really bright 
        jellyfish</ufoDesc>. The sort you see in documentaries glowing in the deep seas. It probably looked 
        nothing like a jellyfish; but that was the general shape. I know I keep repeating myself, but If I 
        google what I saw I bet someone else saw it too. It seemed to descend over my house, but 
        that was just probably the fact that it was <ufoDesc>immensely big</ufoDesc>. My mom is still gobsmacked.</body>
        
        <signature>I had to share this. If I didn't tell anyone I would have probably exploded.
