    <address>DEAR SIR MADAM,</address>

    <body>THE REPENT MIINSTRY OF BERENCE PUBUCATION OF UFO SIGNTINGS SINCE <year>1997</year> HAS
        PROMPTED ME TO WRITE TO YOU WITH THE UFO SIGHTING, I EXPERIENCED DURING THE WAR YEARS OF
            <year>1943/44</year>. APART FROM CLOSE FAMLIY AND FRIENDS, I HANE NEVER OFFICIALLY
        REPORTED THIS INCIDENT THE FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS; IN <year>1943/44</year> I WAS 15-16 YEARS
        OLD LIVING WITH MY PARENTS IN BARKING ESSEX. I WORKED IN <location loc="London"
            >LONDON</location> AND IN ORDER TO AND IN THE COMMUTER QUES FOR TRAIN TICKETS IN THE
        MORINNG, I USED TO PURCHASE MY WORKMANS TICKET THE EVEINNG BEFORE AT <eventName>BARKING
            RAILWAY STATION</eventName>, ON THIS PARTICULAR <weather>EVENINNG</weather>, WALKING FROM MY HOUSE IN
        SOMERSY ROAD INTO SALISURY ROAD TOWARDS BARKING BEATON I SAW IN THE SKY A <ufoDesc>LARGE
            SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT (WITH COLORED LIGHTS ALL AROUND ITâ€™S SIDE) SPINNING AROUND AND
            HOVERING</ufoDesc> ABOVE <eventLocation eloc="Barking_Station">BARKING
            STATION</eventLocation> BEFORE <ufoDesc>SPEEDILY FLOATING AND SPINNING AWAY IN THE
            DIRECTION OF BARKING PARK AND THEN DAGEINAM</ufoDesc>, I WANT TO ASSUME IT TO BE
            <ufoDesc>AROUND 300/400 FT ABOVE THE GROUND LEVEL AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FROM
            IT</ufoDesc> FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING, <ufoDesc>THE SIZE WAS AROUND 7 FEET WIDE AND 2
            FEET DEEP</ufoDesc>. <event>I HAVE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED THIS SIGHTING WITH BEING CONNECTED
            TO THE WAR BUT SEEING ALL THESE PCITURES OF UFO'S, THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE REPLICA OF WHAT
            I SAW</event> IN <year>1943/44</year>. I ENCLOSE THE ARTICLE FROM THE DAILY MAIL. THE
        ILLUSTRATION IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAW ALL THESE YEARS AGO. </body>

    <signature>YOUR COMMENTS WOULD BE APPRECIATED YOUS SINCERELY, [] </signature>
