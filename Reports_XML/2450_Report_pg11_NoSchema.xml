    With regards to the the Airprox incident report 055/08 which involved a West Midlands Police helicopter and
    an unidentified flying object on <eventDate date="05/02/2008">2nd May 2008</eventDate> which shows a very extensive investigation which took place.
    
    We are investigating this incident further as we have 2 additional Police Officers who experienced an <shipDesc>object of
    a similar nature which had blue lights</shipDesc> on the previous night <eventDate date="05/01/2008">1st May</eventDate>.
    We also have acquired photographs from an officer which we are trying to confirm is of that particular night.
    Firstly this incident happened on the <eventDate date="05/02/2008">2nd May</eventDate> and involved an <shipDesc>object with blue/green lights</shipDesc> and was 
    witnessed by a Police helicopter.
    
    We are looking for further assistance and a Freedom of Information request on any details relating to this
    particular event. We are also seeking permission to use details from the Airprox report to further assist us and
    build part of our final report.
