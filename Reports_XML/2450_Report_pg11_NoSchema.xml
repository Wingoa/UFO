    an unidentified flying object on <eventDate date="05/02/2008">2nd May 2008</eventDate> which shows a very extensive investigation which took place.

    a similar nature which had blue lights</ufoDesc> on the previous night <eventDate date="05/01/2008">1st May</eventDate>.
    We also have acquired photographs from an officer which we are trying to confirm is of that particular night.
    Firstly this incident happened on the <eventDate date="05/02/2008">2nd May</eventDate> and involved an <ufoDesc>object with blue/green lights</ufoDesc> and was 
    witnessed by a Police helicopter.

    particular event. We are also seeking permission to use details from the Airprox report to further assist us and
    build part of our final report.
