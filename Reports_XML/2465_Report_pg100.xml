    <address>To whom it may concern,</address>
    <body>On the <eventDate date="11/01/2009">1st of November (2009)</eventDate> at approximately <weather>7:40 pm</weather> We were driving back from the
        Matlock area in <eventLocation eloc="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</eventLocation>. It was an <weather>extremely clear night</weather>, I had strong intuition that I
        should keep my camera with me, I sadly ignored that intuition and <eventName>stuffed it into the boot</eventName>.
        A decision that I would later regret heartily. We had driven for about 15 minutes when I
        became aware of a <ufoDesc>very bright light in the sky</ufoDesc>. Planes fly overhead all the time and I guess
        this <weather>night</weather> was no different than any other, except to say that the <event>plane I saw seemed odd,
            it moved too slowly, considering how low in the sky it was.</event> Moreover it was <ufoDesc>extremely low in
        the sky, helecopter low</ufoDesc>. <weather>It was pitch black outside</weather> the car so I could not get a good look
        at the plane. what I can tell you though is that it's altitude stuck me as odd, as did its
        lights. it seemd to have o<ufoDesc>ne light in the middle and two constant lights on both flanks</ufoDesc>. <ufoDesc>It
        had a small blinking light underneath</ufoDesc>. As it flew low over Carsington water, I'd say it
        <ufoDesc>wouldn't have been more than 300 feet up</ufoDesc> at the very most. My real estimate would have been
        100 feet. Now i'm not saying that <ufoDesc>this was an Alien spacecraft</ufoDesc>. Yet to me <ufoDesc>it was a UFO</ufoDesc>. UFO
        doesn't mean alien spacecraft that would be an ETV (Extra Terrestrial Vehicle). <event>It was a UFO
        because ti wasn't like any plane I have ever seen, it wasn't on a Flight path I have ever
        seen.</event> <ufoDesc>It moved Slower than any commercial plane</ufoDesc> I have ever seen. What was it? I watched it
        fly over Carsington lake and then I lost sight of it for a few seconds, ti was gone. Yet, I
        had a perfect view over the lake, as we climbed towards Kniveton near Ashbourne. Where did
        this low flying object go? I certainly felt unnerved. Rightly so. This part of Derbyshire,
        Matlock, Wirksworth, Bonsall is well known for its UFO reports, even more so lately. This
        year, <event>2009 has seen the highest incidence of UFO reports Worldwide</event> since records began. My
        partner who was driving the car, doesn't really hold with UFO's. I think she'd have to see
        one to believe it. She tends to express the view that there is a rational explanation for
        this sort of sighting and that there is no point making a fuss. This is the view help by the
        majoroty of the population. If fact I believe it too, except that I have long had an
        interest in UFO's because of very unusual things I have seen for years now. On with the
        story. We drove on, I had now got a sneaking suspicion that we would see something else
        unusual. <event>There seemed to be a lot of activity in the skies, but nothing quite as startling
        as what I had just seen</event>. When we got to Uttoxeter, we were approaching the <organization org="MCD">Mcdonalds</organization>
        roundabout when I became aware of a very large red light low in the sky. The red light
        seemed to be near to the Racecourse, it was at least 2 miles away though, so impossible to
        tell what it was, my partner also saw this. She looked a little spooked. I asked her to turn
        off toward the <ufoDesc>light</ufoDesc> but she declined and drove on towards Stoke on Trent. I couldn't help
        but feel that we had missed an opportunity to investigate. That said, having the family in
        the car probably wasn't the best UFO hunting opportunity. We drove on. Then things got
        really good. As we approached Stoke on Trent down the A50. We were at the Britannia stadium
        when I looked across to my right (uk drivers side) and saw a <ufoDesc>very bright white light</ufoDesc> right
        over stoke town. I asked my partner what the hell it was, again she looked spooked and,
        again turned away from it opting to drive down to Newcastle via the Handford roundabout,
        much to my frustration, I wanted to try to get a photograph of this light. <ufoDesc>It was so bright</ufoDesc>.
        As we left the Handford Roundabout the light became visible again. I pointedly asked her to
        look at it. <ufoDesc>It was a white light with tow smaller while lights on either side of it</ufoDesc>. As
        though on stalks or like spotlights. <ufoDesc>We could hear no Helecopter noise</ufoDesc>, even though my
        partner assured me that was what it was. As we drove along the A34 we were both looking at
        this light. It was definitely <ufoDesc>no more than 100 feet off the ground</ufoDesc>. Suddenly, and this is
        the best bit <ufoDesc>it changed colour from white to emerald green</ufoDesc>. Again, I alerted my partner to
        this, I said "look at it, tell me it has changed colour and I'm not imagining it". She
        confirmed that it had changed colour, the two small white sidelights seemed to have
        disappeared. At this point we were directly by the Tesco's at Trent Vale, and I could still
        see the object, I tried to get a photo. I took 2 and one caught a tiny bit of green glow.
        the image was very disappointing. Like so many UFO experiences I had failed to get any
        decent evidence and that truly is frustrating. <event>Simply because 99% of all ufo photos are so
        inconclusive that nothing can be proved</event>. Yet again my photos was certainly no different. If
        only I had kept the SLR in the front with me. Mobile phone pic below taken from inside
        moving car. see left side green glow. sorry thats all i got. Rubbish I know. We arrived home
        minutes late and I scanned around and then went out for a drive to see if I could see
        anything unusual, I couldn't. What we did see that night though was <ufoDesc>3 objects that were
        unusual</ufoDesc>. For once <event>I had another witness who saw at least 2 of these objects</event>. I felt sure
        that this incident was so unusual I simply had to check it out. I called the Police that
        night to ask if the helecopter was up and flying in that region. they said they'd check and
        get back to me. No one got back. So I called again on Monday morning. I spoke with
        <organization org="Staff_Police">Staffordshire Police</organization> and asked them to check. They, recorded the incident (Trent Vale) and
        ran checks to see if the helecopter was flying. They called back to say that they had no
        record of the Police helecopter flying that night. this still doesn't mean it was an ETV,
        but it rules out police helcopters. Other options could be military helecopters or the Air
        Ambulance. I called the <organization org="CAA">Civil Aviation authority</organization> who told me that small aircraft do not have
        to register their flight plan with them. So I have thus drawn a blank. Whatever I saw looked
        weird to me. I'm keen to rule out check all conventional options. Yet I'd just like to say
        that <event>what I saw in all three locations that night is consistent with current UFO sightings
        across the country and the world.</event> i enclose a poorly executed summary image of the craft I
        saw.</body>
