        <organization org="DAS">DAS-UFO-Office</organization> Wiltshire UFOs 20th Sept 2008 HI, This
        is a copy of an email I sent to <organization org="RAF">R.A.F</organization>
        <eventName>Lyneham Airbase</eventName>, Wiltshire after myself and many others witnessed UFO
        craft. it reads as follows..... </head>

    <address>HI,</address>
    <body> I’m an eve witness who lives near <eventLocation eloc="Lyneham_Airbase_Wiltshire">Lyneham
            Air base</eventLocation> in Calne, This <eventDate date="09/20/2008">Saturday 20th
            September 2008</eventDate> myself and many others witnessed UFO activity around
            <weather>10pm</weather> In the Calne area. We witnessed <ufoDesc>5 super bright glowing
            orange/pink orbs at low altitude flying above us that had unusual flying characteristic
            and were totally silent in flight</ufoDesc>! <ufoDesc>They were (NOT) flares</ufoDesc>
        from Salisbury as could elevate as well as descend Did Air traffic control pick these UFOs
        up on radar or know what craft they were? I’m convinced these vessels were not military as
        civilians know of and <ufoDesc>looked of exterrestrial form</ufoDesc> even though I’m aware
        of technology that is hidden from public knowledge! These <ufoDesc>bright orbs</ufoDesc>
        went out of vision as we re-located in an attempt to get a closer viewing and thought we had
        lost the <ufoDesc>vessels</ufoDesc> for good! However less than a minute later <event>we
            followed a <ufoDesc>solo flying fireball</ufoDesc> above us that gradually made its way
            In the direction of Wootton Bassett climbing altitude until</event> could no longer be
        seen Again I think this was <ufoDesc>a craft of some sort and not a comet or weather
            balloon</ufoDesc> as x1 it was <ufoDesc>climbing altitude and travelled to quickly to be
            a balloon</ufoDesc> and eventually entered space Again did Air control track this
            <ufoDesc>huge fireball</ufoDesc> that made a right tum above us towards <location
            loc="Wooton_Bassett">Wootton Bassett</location>? I and others know of Black project
        coverups controlled by your superiors, as its now leaked over the internet for everyone to
        see. However If you have information on this sighting you can share, I would appreciate what
        you could tell me! I have (NOT) reported this to local press as for many would appear a
        total hoax, plus many may not be conditioned in a way they could accept this Hope to hear
        back, </body>
    <signature> Best regards Eye witness. If your <organization org="DAS">DAS</organization>
        Organization can give me further knowledge of exterrestrial technology I want to hear from
        you I know the Nazi history behind it all, project paper clip and the build up of areas -
        The Majestic 12 group and Project Clover leaf </signature>
