    <head>PART A: SUMMARY QF INFORMATION REPORTED TO <eventName>UKAB</eventName> 
    </head>

    <body> THE EC135 PILOT reports flying a routine night police surveillance task on the edge <eventLocation
            eloc="Birmingham">Birmingham</eventLocation> CTR squawking 0060 with Mode C and in
        receipt of a RC service from them. He was operating around 1500ft on the QNH and initially
        In an orbit at 80kt when the front observer <event>saw unidentified lights flying around their ac</event>.
        The pilot established visual contact. He estimated 1OOm away but it was very difficult to
        tell as he <event>maneuvered to avoid collision and to identify the light source</event>. The lights
        appeared to continue to Circle their ac the same height, flew to the N slightly then
        returned. Contact was broken by flying E to <location loc="Birmingham_city">Birmingham City</location> and descending to a lower height
        to enable the lights to be seen against the <weather>dark sky</weather>, but the other ac returned to their
        area. They searched the open land in the area below them with their thermal camera looking
        for any signs of radio-controlled model activity but nothing obvious was found. He believes
        the lights may have come from a radio-controlled fixed wing ac.the lights being to assist
        with night flying, and that it was purposely flown around them. He also thought that the
        <ufoDesc>intent may either have been sinister. or just someone "'messing around”.</ufoDesc> He informed
        Birmingham Radar at the and me who as would be expected saw nothing on the radar. probably
        due to tile small size of the other ac. <organization org="ATSI">ATSI</organization> had nothing to add. UKAB Note (1): The pilot of
        the EC135 was very co-operative and provided additional information when contacted by the
        Secretariat. He is a very experienced helicopter pilot particularly In <weather>night operations</weather>. He
        was engaged on a routine police surveillance task. accompanied by 2 fully trained police
        observers, one visual in the left hand seat and one the rear operating the ac equipment
        and,at the time, using NVGs. All 3 crew members saw <ufoDesc>2 continuous (not flashing} blue/green
        lights</ufoDesc> and the front seat observer saw an object behind the lights. The rear seat observer
        saw the lights on his NVGs but nothing else due to 'blooming'. None of the crew members
        could offer any explanation as to the source of the lights other than that given by the
        plot. The RT recording verifies that the ECt35 · pitot reportable the incident to Radar and
        they responded by saying that there were no other contacts in the area. The pilot discounted
        any 'flashing· from the rotor blades (as reponed as taking place In some helicopter
        operations In the Middle East). He also stated that they thought that the source of the
        lights might be a reflection from the NVG lenses onto the Inside of the ac canopy: this was
        later discounted alter another ac conducted a test on a later flight. 
        
        UKAB Note (2): All
        available radar recordings were examined and Ille EC135 shows throL19hout. squawking with
        Mode C, operating on the edge of the Birmingham CTR, both inside and outside Class D
        airspace. The RT recording shows that the pilot was in contact with Birmingham Radar and
        cleared to operate in the area. At the time the only other ac seen in the area and the only
        other In contact with radar, is a routine <location loc="Birmingham">Birmingham</location> CAT inbound which passes over the
        EC135. well above. (Although he did not report seeing lt, the EC135 pilot was certain that
        the <ufoDesc>lights did not emanate from that ac</ufoDesc>). There were several 'one swoop only' primary
        contacts over 10nm to to W and slightly before the incident time that were attributed to
        anomalous propagation. 
        
        UKAS Note (3}: Due to the pilot's report the first organization
        contacted by the UKAB in attempting to trace the source of the lights was the <organization org="BMFA">British Model
        Flying Association</organization>. Their view was that the object could not have been a model ac as it
        would have been too high and they had no reports of any activity <weather>at night</weather>. In addition it
        would not, In their view been possible to control a normal (in size and control system)
        model ac at that height since any light would not have been sufficient to enable control. In
        pursuing more sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles, known civil, police and military
        operators of UAVs were contacted and no activity was reported (in any case it was a most
        unlikely) <event>location and time for the operation of UAVs, indeed virtually impossible for
        military UAV activity</event>). <event>Military flights were ruled out since there was no squawk observed
        and the area is out with the UKLFS.</event> <event>Gliders, kites, tethered and untethered balloons were
        ruled out due ID the light and weather conditions</event>. There are no Met balloon launch s as in
        the area. All local GA airfields (except Halfpenny Green) reported no night activity on the
        date of the incident. The activity from Halfpenny Green was police operations that had
        landed before the incident time. Since the incident occurred in good radar coverage (both
        Birmingham and <location loc="Ctee_hill">Ctee Hill</location>) and no contacts either squawking or primary­ only were evident
        within 20nm of the incident position, it Is thought most unlikely that the lights emanated
        from normal GA, other police or air ambulance activity. <event>A laser light show was also
        discounted since there was no cloud base for the lights to be reflected on</event>. F<event>ireworks or
        flares were also discounted since the light source did not descend towards the ground as,
        even with parachute flares, would be the case and, in any case, the lights reported were not
        bright enough to be pyrotechnics</event>. The authorities for the parks close to1heincident area
        ware contacted but they had no activity recorded for the evening of <eventDate date="06/02/1980">2 May</eventDate>. Although the
        possibility of a civilian clandestine flight by a microlight or similar ac could not be
        ruled out, it is thought unlikely that any pilot engaged on illegal airborne activity would
        omit what could probably be identified as a police helicopter. <event>Regrettably therefore,
        despite extensive tracing the source of the lights could not be identified. </event>
        
        PART B:
        
        SUMMARY.OF TKEBOARD'S DISCUSSIONS Information available included reports from the helicopter
        pilot, a recording of the relevant RT frequency, radar video recordings and a report from
        the appropriate <organization org="ATC">ATC</organization> authorities. The Board noted the extensive tracing action taken by the
        Secretariat and accepted that any further efforts was unlikely to determine the source of
        the lights reported by the E:C135 pilot which, despite there being no information to support
        the crew's (unanimous) sighting, Members accepted totally as being accurate. The Board,
        which Included a very experienced helicopter pilot Member with extensive experience of
        civil, military and police helicopter operations, was Invited to offer an explanation as to
        the source of the lights: none was forthcoming. The possibility of a clandestine flight was
        only one of several possibilities and Members were not convinced that, other than by
        exclusion of other logical possibilities. there was _sufficient information to mention this
        in the cause, Certainly however, the ac from which the <ufoDesc>lights elumanated had been small and
        probably non-metallic </ufoDesc>since It was not displayed on either of the radars examined and had
        not been displaying the lighting required by the ANO. Members agreed unanimously that they
        did not have enough information to determine a degree of risk involved In the incident PART
        C; ASSESSMENT OFCAUSE ANORISK Cause: An apparent conflict with an unidentified ac displaying
        non-standard lights. Degree of Risk: D. </body>
