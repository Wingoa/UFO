    <body> I attach photographs of a <ufoDesc>flying object</ufoDesc> I encountered over <eventLocation eloc="Filey_Town_Center">Filey town centre</eventLocation> at <weather>00:46</weather>
        yesterday (<eventDate date="09/02/2009">2nd September</eventDate>.) <event>I was completely transfixed by it and watched it for a few
        minutes before I panicked and hurried back to my parents flat</event>. The best way I can describe
        its appearance is <ufoDesc>a brilliant and dazzling pure white horizontal ring of light</ufoDesc>. It appeared
        to be <ufoDesc>perfectly still in the sky above the houses and was totally silent</ufoDesc>. I took these
        pictures from the corner of Chapel Street and Station Avenue and I would estimate that it
        was hovering above the <eventName>Belle Vue Crescent area</eventName>. I noticed that <organization org="RAF">RAF</organization> jets were doing fly over
        the town the following morning.... surely this is not a coincidence? <event>All I can say is that
        it was the strangest experience of my life and thought I should report it to someone</event>.</body>
