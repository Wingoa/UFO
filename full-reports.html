                              1st May. We also have acquired photographs from an officer which we are trying to
                              confirm is of that particular night. Firstly this incident happened on the 2nd
                              May and involved an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">object with blue/green lights</span> and was witnessed by a
                              Police helicopter. We are looking for further assistance and a Freedom of Information

                              to
                              use details from the Airprox report to further assist us and build part of our final
                              report.

                           <p>DEAR SIR MADAM,</p>
                           <p>THE REPENT MIINSTRY OF BERENCE PUBUCATION OF UFO SIGNTINGS SINCE 1997 HAS
                              PROMPTED ME TO WRITE TO YOU WITH THE UFO SIGHTING, I EXPERIENCED DURING THE WAR YEARS
                              OF
                              1943/44. APART FROM CLOSE FAMLIY AND FRIENDS, I HANE NEVER OFFICIALLY
                              REPORTED THIS INCIDENT THE FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS; IN 1943/44 I WAS 15-16 YEARS
                              OLD LIVING WITH MY PARENTS IN BARKING ESSEX. I WORKED IN LONDON AND IN ORDER TO AND IN THE COMMUTER QUES FOR TRAIN TICKETS IN THE
                              MORINNG, I USED TO PURCHASE MY WORKMANS TICKET THE EVEINNG BEFORE AT BARKING
                              RAILWAY STATION, ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENINNG, WALKING FROM MY HOUSE IN
                              SOMERSY ROAD INTO SALISURY ROAD TOWARDS BARKING BEATON I SAW IN THE SKY A <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">LARGE
                                 SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT (WITH COLORED LIGHTS ALL AROUND IT’S SIDE) SPINNING AROUND AND
                                 HOVERING</span> ABOVE BARKING
                              STATION BEFORE <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">SPEEDILY FLOATING AND SPINNING AWAY IN THE
                                 DIRECTION OF BARKING PARK AND THEN DAGEINAM</span>, I WANT TO ASSUME IT TO BE
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">AROUND 300/400 FT ABOVE THE GROUND LEVEL AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FROM
                                 IT</span> FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">THE SIZE WAS AROUND 7 FEET WIDE AND 2
                                 FEET DEEP</span>. I HAVE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED THIS SIGHTING WITH BEING CONNECTED
                              TO THE WAR BUT SEEING ALL THESE PCITURES OF UFO'S, THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE REPLICA OF
                              WHAT
                              I SAW IN 1943/44. I ENCLOSE THE ARTICLE FROM THE DAILY MAIL. THE
                              ILLUSTRATION IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAW ALL THESE YEARS AGO. </p>

                           <p> As you know, OSI has completed a report on the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">landing of a craft of unknown origin crewed by several entities</span> near
                              RAF Bentwaters on the night of the
                              <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">12/29/1980</span>. Interestingly,
                              OSI reports that the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">entities were
                                 approximately 1 ½ meters tall, wearing what appeared to be nylon coated pressure suits,
                                 but no helmets</span>. Conditions on the night were misty,
                              giving the appearance that the entities were hovering above ground level. Tape recordings
                              were made on which the entities are heard to speak in an electronically synthesised
                              version
                              of English, with a strong American accent. Similar transmissions intercepted irregularly by
                              ISA(?) since 1973(see attachment- Flag 1). According to OSI, entities had claw-like hands and with three fingers and
                              an opposable thumb. Despite original reports(Flags 3- 0), OSI said <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the craft was not damaged but landed deliberately as
                                 part of a series of visits</span> to SAC bases in USA and Europe. Reports that craft was repaired
                              by US serviceman or was taken on to the base are not confirmed by OSI. Landing is not considered a defence issue in view of the
                              overt peaceful nature of the contact, but investigations by [] are to be
                              continued on [] authority. Precautionary plans for counter-information at a local
                              level
                              involving [] and [] is strongly recommended. </p>

                           <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
                           <p>I live by Waterloo, London, on a 10th floor
                              flat overlooking a substantial part of the southern part of the city. I have become quite
                              perturbed over the past couple of nights by UFO's, of which I believe that I have seen
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">3 of varying sizes</span>. My profession is of that of a CEO of two
                              companies listed on the stockmarket, so i think myself to be a sensible and sane individual.
                              The sightings involve <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">one object with a white light and alternating red lights at
                                 an angle</span>. The object came from south-east London, headed toward
                              Canary Wharf,<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> stopped in mid air</span>, at which
                              point <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">an alternating sequence of red lights flashed at a 180 degree angle</span>
                              with <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the top light being on the left hand side of the object</span> with the
                              lights moving down toward the bottom right of the angle, before the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights switched
                                 side instantaneously and the object went back toward south-east</span> London.
                              Roughly <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">one minute later the object returned in my direction</span>,
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the red lights continuing to lash alongside it</span>, before it headed
                              north over my apartment and out of sight. My most recent sighting took place at
                              22:52 tonight, 23 February 2009. This sighting occurred for four
                              seconds, and was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the flashing of a huge object taking up a portion of the sky the
                                 size</span> of which I have never seen before. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It appeared to be flying
                                 low</span>, and had, as I recall, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three lights</span>, of which one I
                              believe was a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">normal white light, and the other two were green lights</span>.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It vanished out of my sight almost immediately</span>, and I was unable to
                              track the lights. If you are able to shed light on either of these two incidents I
                              would be
                              most grateful. I do not proclaim to be an expert in helicopters, but am able to spot one
                              from my window with ease normally.</p>
                           <p> Many thanks. Yours Faithfully, []</p>

                           <p> I am writing to tell you what I really saw. In <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">10/01/1992</span> me and my 2 friends were in a town called Witchurch []. We were parked up for about an
                              hour got out of the Datsun cherry car walked around the
                              corner 3 mins away no sound listening 4 sounds because we were up to no good. Whent
                              back to
                              the car it was gone me and my 2 mates who can conferm this true story I am telling.
                              The car
                              had gone the day in back seats gone and my tent, as we were all baffled by what was
                              happening all of us in dis-belife. Where does the car go <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no sound</span> just
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">round corner 3 mins and gone vanished</span>. Walking down a long road and
                              all 3 saw [] I said look Boys what the fuck is that in dis-belief. I said look
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">pink flamingos flying south for summer</span>, [] gigging me mate. Said
                              their <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">fire flies</span> I giggled with my mate. My other mate said nothing. Their
                              were about <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">12-15 flying objects in the sky</span> they were in
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">formation of a triangle</span>. I hear <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no sounds</span> we see

                              Drickie traveling towards Lancaster and captured <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">something flying
                                 in the sky</span> above a grassy ridge. I was using a canon 7-million-pixel digital
                              camera. I saw the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">craft hovering for a few minutes</span> and was able to take
                              this snap. Whlist waiting for the camera to a cock itself for the next frame, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the
                                 craft took off vertically at an amazing velocity</span>. The craft, however,
                              was unfortunately in the shadow of a cloud and cannot be seer to cast a

                           <p>Anyway, with reference to what I saw on my trip to Gatwick on
                              Monday
                              <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">09/01/2008</span>, here is my account of what took
                              place. I was en route to collect my neighbour's wife and children from her return
                              trip from Toronto. Her time of arrival was 11am, I was
                              advised by my neighbour that I should plan to be there about 11.30am, although I wanted
                              to
                              be a little earlier on arrival for parking and a coffee, but found myself running
                              late after
                              getting to grips with a new Satellite Navigation system and moments of slow motorway
                              traffic. At about 11.05am I was still travelling south, somewhere from the M25 to
                              the M23. I
                              would have to provide a 'guesstimate' of my rough location after tracing my route
                              and being
                              some 20-25 mlnutes away from Gatwick Airport
                              Itself and on the M23 southbound. Because I was working with a brand new Sat Nav system
                              I
                              could not immediately Identify my spot location from the map vlew (I had a Navman
                              which was
                              in a planned route mode and gave a limited vlew of where I was). But I think I was
                              on the
                              M23 not too far from the M25 junction. It was raining to some degree, I
                              had my windscreen wipers operated and car windscreen was clean and without mist with
                              car
                              air-con functional (I drive a Volvo V70). I was in the central lane paying attention
                              to
                              driving hazards and traffic progression (this being skills learnt from the Institute
                              Advanced Motorists standards and police driving standards), basically scanning from
                              horizon
                              to car bonnet and back to horizon taking into account all traffic and it's local
                              environment. times I would glance in to the sky to try to get vlew of flights in bound
                              to
                              Gatwick and an idea of my closeness to destination. It was at this point soon after
                              I saw
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a flash and bright light in the sky</span> and Immediately associated it
                              with a plane or helicopter (where I live in Waltham Abbey gives a regular view of
                              commercial
                              type flights and helicopter flights as a Met police helicopter landing site is near
                              my house
                              about 1 mile. I walted to identify either a jet plane or helicopter. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The bright
                                 light stopped</span> and (I expected to see the plane or helicopter) allowed a side
                              profile to be viewed as <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the air-borne vehicle travelled from left to
                                 right</span>. At all times I continued to have casual peripheral vision on the
                              motorway traffic which was continuous and regular. I continued to watch the sky not
                              thinking
                              anything unusual and then this <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">oval shaped object</span> (I now realise it could
                              only match a helicopter in <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it's side profile was missing it's rear tail</span>),
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">accelerated at a colossal speed, faster than any aircraft I have or been aware
                                 of</span> accelerating before and base this on attending airshows a s a child and
                              even seelng jet fighters fly over my junlor school when a child in Loughton, Essex
                              on the
                              1970's which included the sound boom. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">This unusual oval shaped Ariel vehicle, after
                                 accelerating, just vanished out of view.</span>
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was quite small in size</span> and appeared to be below cloud cover, but I
                              cannot say categorically. Until It disappeared it was constant and visible and perhaps
                              1mile
                              away, but this is hard to say. Overall, this incident lasted for about 5- 10
                              seconds. Once it had disappeared, I had limited time to re-assess it's location
                              as my road position changed and meant I had to look to my right and through my driver's
                              door
                              window. I have not reported this to MOD, for a
                              limited information feedback reason, I have been aware of such matters in the past
                              as I have
                              pald casual attention to this interest since the mid 1990's (during my time in the
                              Met Police) and relevant book releases and
                              programmes.</p>
                           <p>I would be happy to discuss this further if necessary. Regards, </p>

                              Lyneham Airbase, Wiltshire after myself and many others witnessed UFO
                              craft. it reads as follows..... </p>
                           <p>HI,</p>
                           <p> I’m an eve witness who lives near Lyneham
                              Air base in Calne, This <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">09/20/2008</span> myself and many others witnessed UFO activity around
                              10pm In the Calne area. We witnessed <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">5 super bright glowing
                                 orange/pink orbs at low altitude flying above us that had unusual flying characteristic
                                 and were totally silent in flight</span>! <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They were (NOT) flares</span>
                              from Salisbury as could elevate as well as descend Did Air traffic control pick these
                              UFOs
                              up on radar or know what craft they were? I’m convinced these vessels were not military
                              as
                              civilians know of and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">looked of exterrestrial form</span> even though I’m aware
                              of technology that is hidden from public knowledge! These <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright orbs</span>
                              went out of vision as we re-located in an attempt to get a closer viewing and thought
                              we had
                              lost the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">vessels</span> for good! However less than a minute later we
                              followed a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">solo flying fireball</span> above us that gradually made its way
                              In the direction of Wootton Bassett climbing altitude until could no longer be
                              seen Again I think this was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a craft of some sort and not a comet or weather
                                 balloon</span> as x1 it was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">climbing altitude and travelled to quickly to be
                                 a balloon</span> and eventually entered space Again did Air control track this
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">huge fireball</span> that made a right tum above us towards Wootton Bassett? I and others know of Black project

                              what
                              you could tell me! I have (NOT) reported this to local press as for many would appear
                              a
                              total hoax, plus many may not be conditioned in a way they could accept this Hope
                              to hear

                              Organization can give me further knowledge of exterrestrial technology I want to hear

                           <p></p>
                           <p> Firstly I must stress that I am one of the world’s biggest sceptics when it come
                              to UFO’s however I can offer no realistic explanation for what I saw, therefore
                              it was literally an unidentified flying object. I was working in the air traffic control
                              at
                              RAF Lyneham in Willshire on night shift. I was the approach
                              controller and supervisor of the shirt. At the time I must have had almost 20 years
                              of
                              working on radar and was very used to analyzing the quirks which a radar can produce
                              such as
                              bird activity, ananprop (atmospheric variation) and MTI suppression. I was recovering
                              a
                              couple of C130’s to base when I saw a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">large “blob”</span> on the radar screen
                              about 3 miles from touchdown on the center line. I had no idea what it was so I called
                              it to
                              the pilots and fed them around it. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The blob was stationary</span>. I handed the
                              aircraft over to the visual controller and then went upstairs to the visual control
                              room
                              where I could see <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the “blob”</span> on the DFTI (distance from touchdown
                              indicator). I looked through the window but couldn’t see anything, so I returned to
                              the
                              radar room. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Suddenly the “blob” burst and fragmented shooting off in all directions
                                 at massive speed</span>. Some discussion took place between me and the visual
                              controller and we left it at that. Sometime later I received a phone call from a very
                              agitated airman who said “Sir I have not been drinking, I am on guard duty and
                              have just seen something that was very strange, and I can’t explain but thought the
                              Air
                              traffic controller should be informed of. He said he had seen a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright
                                 light</span> to the east I remember commenting that it was nearly Christmas but
                              doubted that we would find 3 wise men or a virgin at Lyneham. He said that the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright light had burst and that fragments
                                 had shot in all directions at speeds which he could not believe</span>. He said he
                              had <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">never seen anything travel so fast and it was definitely not an
                                 aircraft</span>. His account caused the hairs on my neck to stand up.
                              Several minutes later another airman telephoned and gave a similar
                              account. I logged all the details and telephoned the MOD UFO desk, gave them a
                              verbal report backed up with a written report which hopefully they will still have
                              on
                              record. This happened just before Christmas but I struggle top remember the year.
                              I served
                              at Lyneham in the early to mid 90’s and I
                              guess it would be <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">12/24/1995</span>. I Think
                              the visual controller was a chap called [] who was a Sergeant at the time because
                              I cannot
                              justify or explain it any better than I have to you. Please call me on my mobile if
                              you
                              would like to discuss it more. [] </p>

                           <p> Hi,</p>
                           <p>I'm not sure that these were UFOs, but last night on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">02/02/2009</span> I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">2 strange lights in the sky</span> over
                              Basingstoke in Hampshire. At
                              11:1Opm my partner and I noticed a very <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> bright orange light
                                 travelling very fast</span> from North to South East. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was too large and
                                 bright to be a plane</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was in view for approx 1 minute then
                                 disappeared behind a cloud</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">We could notice no noise or
                                 tail</span>. At 12:10am on 8 February I noticed what appeared to
                              be an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">extremely bright</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">white star</span>, where the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange light</span> had originated. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The star seemed to fall out of
                                 the sky, towards the ground very quickly</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It disappeared within
                                 seconds</span>. If you happen to know what these lights were and could let me know, I
                              would appreciate it.</p>

                           <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                           <p>
                              Sighting of same UFO type on two continents. I want to impress you
                              first with my qualifications for knowing what I saw and secondly for being able to
                              identify
                              that what I saw was not a normal aerial object. For some twenty five years I was in
                              the
                              Army of Great Britain and Australia as a National Serviceman and then as a
                              Territorial Army and Citizens' Military Force Volunteer. My final rank was Captain.
                              In the
                              British Army, my number was [] and my
                              main occupation waws Forward Observer in Field Artillery but I also served in a light
                              Anti-aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery where you served by identification of
                              enemy aircraft in time to take proper action. For more than twenty-five
                              years I studied aircraft recognition as a civilian amateur and as a military
                              professional. From the foregoing I hope that you may realise that I have been
                              trained, have experience and are able to dentify objects, their shape and dimensions
                              at a
                              distance. It may be considered that if I say that I saw something and describe it
                              in detail
                              I did see it and that it did exist at two separate times in separate places on two
                              continents. Early in <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">??/??/2007</span>, I cannot give you the
                              exact date because that did not become important until my second sighting, one morning
                              I was
                              in my front garden in Hawthorn, an inner suburb of
                              Melbourne, Australia. I heard
                              a large jet aeroplane approaching from the east at low level and recognised the sound
                              of a
                              Boeing 747. I got hold of my binoculars, which I keep handy for such occasions, captured
                              the
                              image and followed the plane as it passed slowly from east to west across my front.
                              It was
                              to my north about 1,000 metres from me at as low a level as such planes are permitted
                              to fly
                              across the inner areas of Melbourne, on a line of sight
                              about fifteen degrees of elevation from me, in its sweeping approach to Tullamarine
                              airport
                              gone fifteen kilometres away. The sky was clear cloudless blue. As I
                              scanned back along the fuselage to the white kangaroo on the red tail of the Qadtas
                              jumbo I
                              saw behind and beyond the tail by at least 500 metres an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">object in the
                                 sky</span>. I recall thinking I'll follow the 747 until it goes behind the nearby
                              houses and then come back to the object. It was an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">unusual shape</span>. The
                              other day I heard a news broadcast which mentioned the UFO desk at MOD in London and as a result I have
                              directed my report to you. If you require any other information, please let me know,
                              otherwise, I do not expect you to expend your valuable time on a reply. </p>
                           <p>Yours faithfully, []</p>

                           <p></p>
                           <p>During the early hours of 15 February 2009 at around
                              00:15hrs i was with my wife and two friends driving through
                              Winwick Warrington. I was
                              driving and sighted <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">two orange lights in the sky</span> which was
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">hovering over the old hospital</span> sight that is now a housing
                              development. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The lights were not together but were stationary</span>. We stopped
                              the car and got out to have a look. As we did we saw other people in nearby houses also
                              stood looking at them. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">There was no noise from them at all</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">One
                                 then began moving and moved away out of sight</span> in a southern direction.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The second light stayed in placed and then after around 30 seconds also moved
                                 away</span> in the same direction. Again <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">there was no noise</span>.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was out of sight within around 15 seconds</span>. There was definitely
                              something strange about it I am not a real believer in ufos but there is no other
                              explanation. </p>

                           <p><span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">I suspect they were meteors</span> (do not believe in ET!), however, my
                              Husband, two young children and I all clearly witnessed some <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">very strange lights in
                                 the sky</span> over Farleigh/Warlingham, Surrey last night, (<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">03/01/2008</span>) at approximately 7pm.
                              We were driving home from Selsdon, Surrey, and heading up Farleigh Road towards Warlingham
                              when we spotted <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three very bright orange lights</span> in the sky. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They
                                 appeared circular, with no tail</span> that was visible, and were travelling at speed
                              towards the East (approx). <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They were visible for a good 4-5 minutes very
                                 brightly</span>, at which pointed they slowly faded and disappeard one by one. I saw
                              one on it's own first off, which appeared to be just above the tree line ahead, and thought
                              it looked like an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange street lamp</span>, but realised that as we rounded the
                              corner there were two others - <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">they were all high in the sky and together they
                                 appeard to be in a triangular formation to start</span>. We pulled over in the
                              entrance to Farleigh Golf Club and watched as they flew over our head before dissapearing.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They made no noise</span>, and we could not tell how high they were. Someone
                              pulled over behind us, pressumably to watch too, however, we did not speak to them.
                              Would
                              love to know if these <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights</span> have been reported by anyone else and if
                              anyone would know what it was we saw. Why do we never have a camera when we really
                              need one! </p>
                           <p>A response would be much appreciated. Many thanks []</p>

                           <p>Dear Sir/ Madam,</p>
                           <p>Please forgive me if I have your information wrong. I have been given advice from
                              a
                              colleague of mine to contact yourself. This was not reported to Police per say but
                              I thought
                              I ought to let you know as I saw it. I have been a serving Police Officer for a
                              number of years now and my Partner Karl Norman who was with me at the time is an
                              ex serviceman in the RAF. I was at my friends address
                              in Brightlingsea, Essex on New
                              Years Eve seeing in the New Year, just before midnight myself and my
                              partner were in the back garden having a cigarette; I could hear fireworks in the
                              distance so looked up to see it I could see them. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">In the sky was a
                                 bright orange/yellow light</span> at first glance I Ignored it thinking it was
                              a trailing firework but then double took as it did not disappear. My immediate
                              thought was we are near water and perhaps that could explain the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">light</span>
                              but it still did not disappear, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it moved very slowly in like a half circle around
                                 the top of us</span> then <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">stopped over the water</span> between Brightingsea and East Mersea. It was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">quite
                                 large</span> and the night was extremely clear with no clouds or
                              mist. I would hazard a guess about <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">1500 to 2000 feet up</span>.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It stayed perfectly still for about 3-4 minutes then appeared to shoot straight
                                 up in the air very fast, going completely out of view in less then 30 seconds</span>,
                              I must be honest I stood there a bit in awe and missed the start of the new year
                              because of it. In fact I even called my friends daughter to see it! It may be
                              completely trivial to you and you may even press the delete button, but after a few
                              days of
                              wondering whether I was seeing things I saw the news about the Lincoln sightings and
                              damage
                              to the wind turbine I could have fallen off my seat it was very similar to what I
                              saw New
                              years eve. With Karl being ex RAF I asked him quite
                              innocently what it was and he was as disturbed as I was with no answer! I would not
                              have
                              bothered you with it in all honesty but having it play on my mind a few days I thought
                              you
                              were the best people to make the decision about whether it was worth your time or
                              not. If
                              you have any questions or queries I will be happy to assist in any way possible. My

                           <p> The Sun has reported a UFO sighting over Temhill Barracks in Shropshire at about 11pm on 7 June
                              2008. It appears that a number of soldiers saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights in the sky</span> and made a
                              video which they have passed to the newspaper. They have not made a formal written
                              report on
                              the matter, although they did inform their superiors. The MoD in London became involved when the
                              press office was contacted by the newspaper on 24th June. On 25th June I requested
                              a copy of
                              the video from Media Ops at HQ 5 Div where it had been passed by the unit concerned. It
                              shows a number of lights in the sky. As reported in the paper, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the lights change
                                 colour and appear square, but this looks like the pixels snag up as the photographer
                                 zoomed in. They do not appear to be moving vary quickly</span>. The BBC has reported
                              that at the same time as the alleged incident, a local hotel was lighting off Chinese
                              lanterns and, apparently, the hotel manager thinks the whole UFO story is “highly
                              hilarious”. I do not intend to investigate any further as I think we have our answer and, as
                              I suspect there might be copyright issues surrounding the video, do not intend to
                              retain a
                              copy on our files. I will inform the soldiers of my decision through their 2ic. </p>

                              (Tel
                              No: [] ) telephoned the RAF Lyneham ATC Supervisor on
                              Monday, 15 Jun 09 to ask whether we had had any <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">unusual aircraft</span> in the
                              vicinity of Wroughton
                              between 1930 and 200hrs (local) the previous evening (14 Jun 09). I told
                              him that nothing had been seen by the Lyneham controllers and we had had no reports
                              of
                              anything unusual. He told me that he had seen <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">black, disc-shaped objects</span>,
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">50ft in diameter</span> with <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights shining from beneath</span>
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">them hovering over crop circles</span> near Barbury Castle (near Wroughton, just
                              south of Junction 15 of the M4). T<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">he discs cast shadows beneath them</span> and
                              were captured on two separate video cameras. He asked me to let him know
                              if we discovered anything about the objects.</p>
                           <p>I hope that this is of interest to you. Regards []</p>

                           <p>On the above heading is what I've seen, spotted over the years some I've takes photo's
                              as
                              well as videos of some from <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">06/01/2007</span> plus others in the past few weeks which I've made it public in the
                              local paper. Some of the UFO'S which you can just make their shape out, but the one
                              I took
                              in 2007 when videoed <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it took less than 6 of second to enter and disappear when it
                                 buzzed this old WWIl tempest plane</span> in the area of Dornock town and Fastriggs,
                              the other outside my back garden when I videoed an RAF jet circling the area several times before I went out with my camera
                              which was a cold cloudy day, when I started to video the jet at the same
                              time this <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">UFO just popped out from behind a cloud going all over the place and back
                                 into the clouds them there were others doing the same but only two of them just kept
                                 popping in and out of the clouds while the rest just stayed behind thin layers of
                                 the
                                 clouds I could just make out</span>. All the others were taken by different cameras I
                              have and one that struck me the most of all when I did not have my camera then bat
                              I
                              watched it for about 20 minutes
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was all black, no port windows, no strobe lights, no sign of where the engines
                                 were as one would on any air craft, no sound at all very quiet</span>, but underneath
                              was what struck me most of all? This UFO, would be about<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> 40/60 feet circular the
                                 height from the bottom of the UFO to the top part about 15/20</span> if no
                              more?<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> Underneath this craft had two different shaped type boxes then all the
                                 arca of it had earth military type camouflage we use on all vehicles and
                                 planes</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was about 500/1000feet above me and it just look like a
                                 giant Frisbe</span>e! This was August 1996 Sunday A very clear blue sky it
                              was 1:15pm, once I got home I made a model of it and made a rough birds eye
                              view of it's path as it went over the Solway cost over into England towards the East
                              coast?
                              I keep a kind of record of them so that I can keep track and numbers I've seen and
                              caught on
                              my cameras over the years. I'm not on the internet or other nets, as I can't afford
                              the cost
                              or a decent PC, had do my best with I have, though I have been interested in UFO'S
                              since my
                              school days and would like to know how far back the UK M.O,D., has known of these
                              space
                              crafts that keep popping in and out of our planet buzzing our aircrafts or just floating
                              over at a slow speed which you can pick out all the details but don't disappear or
                              change
                              shape. I had <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">two silver orbs</span> on video one taken at the solway coast and
                              above my house tie latest I got was the last week of May 2009 while photographing
                              two jets
                              going in different directions when I saw<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> 3 large spaceships</span> but managed
                              to get all on my SLR camera but 2of them when blown up <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">look like battle ships from
                                 Star Wars Film its on cunning with the shape</span> they are! To me they are the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">mother of all space crafts</span> I've ever seen. What I hope if possible,
                              of a list of' these crafts since seen and reported in our country to date plus any
                              true
                              videos/films and photos of these crafts as I would like to remake all my cuttings
                              and
                              information of magazines in order of date de lime of year. I'm X- RAF, ARIR and R.O.C. Look forward to hearing from</p>

                              release-authorised: UFO sighting at Tern
                              Hill
                              </p>
                           <p>[]</p>
                           <p> We spoke, but the following is the basic story: I took a call this morning from the
                              2IC
                              rear part at 1 Royal Irish at Tern Hill
                              Capt[] on [] A soldier who was part of a fire picket stagging on at the camp on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">06/07/2008</span> took video footage with a camera on a mobile phone
                              of what he says were "UFOs" in the sky above the camp - which they have
                              emailed to The Sun - and which The Sun is apparently planning on splashing - probably
                              tomorrow. I don't have all the details/timings but what I do have is the following:
                              1.
                              Soldier is Cpl [] who the phone belongs to- he was accompanied by Pte [] who also
                              witnessed
                              the "UFOs". 2. The footage was taken on 7 June at 23.03
                                          hrs, - with a 5 megapixel camera on the phone. 3. 2IC rear party says
                              the
                              video images are very good. 4. The 2IC says the images could not have been anything
                              to do
                              with nearby RAF Shawbury. 5. They show lots of
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">multi-coloured dots and zoom in on a cube shaped object which then
                                 flattens</span>. 6. The Sun has already interviewed Cpl [] - he has explained to them
                              what he saw. 7. There is some suggestion of payment being offered - thought I think
                              a
                              discussion about that has still to happen. 8. I have reminded all, the 2IC and Cpl
                              [] about
                              their responsibilities ref the DIN on communicating with the media. 9. Cpl [] spoke
                              to [] an
                              editor at The Sun (?) 10.Cpl [] mobile number is [] 11.I spoke to the CRO at RAF Shawbury who said he was not aware - Sqn Ldr [] [] []

                           <p>Hi,</p>
                           <p>I'm sure you must get so many reports of UFOs, but I thought you might be interested
                              in my
                              experience tonight I can't quite believe what I saw tonight, but it made me rush out
                              onto
                              the street camera in hand. I was very sober when I saw what I am about to describe.
                              Until
                              recently I was a journalist and we used to get similar stories like this from time
                              to time
                              which we would all have a good laugh at (not any more!) I was sitting on the couch
                              when I
                              saw an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange light in the sky</span>. My initial thoughts were 'that
                              plane is flying low· and I went back to watching TV. However, five/ten minutes
                              or so later I couldn't believe it when I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">several orange lights</span> -
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">about the same colour and brightness of street lights</span> -
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">about half a dozen in total</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Three of them were closer
                                 together than the others and were in a straight, but horizontal line.</span>
                              I shouted upstairs to my boyfriend, who also witnessed the incident. I then
                              told him I was getting the camera before running outside -with no shoes on (the neighbours
                              must think I'm mad). Unfortunately my camera is not great, but I have attached the
                              pictures
                              anyway in the hope you can enhance them. On the one marked UFO 001 you can see <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a
                                 round shape</span>, which was not visible to the naked eye and only appeared when I
                              blew up the photo. I believe it may show the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three lights in a horizontal
                                 line</span> I described earlier. The whole incident could have only happened
                              over a couple of minutes, maybe less. The lights seemed to fade away, except one
                              which I saw go behind some houses and I followed it a short way down the street on
                              foot
                              before it also disappeared. The incident happened around 9:20pm today
                              (<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">04/11/2009</span>). I live in a village
                              called which is in Chesterfield,
                              Derbyshire. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else saw what I
                              have described and if any explanation can be given.</p>

                              C and in receipt of a RC service from them. He was operating around 1500ft on the

                              initially In an orbit at 80kt when the front observer saw unidentified lights flying
                              around their ac. The pilot established visual contact. He estimated 1OOm away
                              but it was very difficult to tell as he maneuvered to avoid collision and to identify
                              the light source. The lights appeared to continue to Circle their ac the same
                              height, flew to the N slightly then returned. Contact was broken by flying E to Birmingham City and descending to a lower height to
                              enable the lights to be seen against the dark sky, but the other ac
                              returned to their area. They searched the open land in the area below them with their
                              thermal camera looking for any signs of radio-controlled model activity but nothing
                              obvious
                              was found. He believes the lights may have come from a radio-controlled fixed wing

                              also thought that the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">intent may either have been sinister. or just someone

                              pilot of the EC135 was very co-operative and provided additional information when
                              contacted

                              operating the ac equipment and,at the time, using NVGs. All 3 crew members saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">2
                                 continuous (not flashing} blue/green lights</span> and the front seat observer saw an
                              object behind the lights. The rear seat observer saw the lights on his NVGs but nothing
                              else
                              due to 'blooming'. None of the crew members could offer any explanation as to the
                              source of
                              the lights other than that given by the plot. The RT recording verifies that the ECt35

                              pitot reportable the incident to Radar and they responded by saying that there were
                              no other
                              contacts in the area. The pilot discounted any 'flashing· from the rotor blades (as
                              reponed
                              as taking place In some helicopter operations In the Middle East). He also stated
                              that they
                              thought that the source of the lights might be a reflection from the NVG lenses onto
                              the
                              Inside of the ac canopy: this was later discounted alter another ac conducted a test
                              on a
                              later flight. UKAB Note (2): All available radar recordings were examined and Ille

                              inside and outside Class D airspace. The RT recording shows that the pilot was in

                              with Birmingham Radar and cleared to operate in the area. At the time the only other
                              ac seen
                              in the area and the only other In contact with radar, is a routine Birmingham CAT inbound which passes over the EC135. well
                              above. (Although he did not report seeing lt, the EC135 pilot was certain that the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights did not emanate from that ac</span>). There were several 'one swoop
                              only' primary contacts over 10nm to to W and slightly before the incident time that
                              were
                              attributed to anomalous propagation. UKAS Note (3}: Due to the pilot's report the
                              first
                              organization contacted by the UKAB in attempting to trace the source of the lights
                              was the
                              British Model Flying Association. Their view was
                              that the object could not have been a model ac as it would have been too high and
                              they had
                              no reports of any activity at night. In addition it would not, In their
                              view been possible to control a normal (in size and control system) model ac at that
                              height
                              since any light would not have been sufficient to enable control. In pursuing more
                              sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles, known civil, police and military operators
                              of UAVs
                              were contacted and no activity was reported (in any case it was a most unlikely)
                              location and time for the operation of UAVs, indeed virtually impossible for
                              military UAV activity). Military flights were ruled out since there was
                              no squawk observed and the area is out with the UKLFS.
                              Gliders, kites, tethered and untethered balloons were ruled out due ID the light and
                              weather conditions. There are no Met balloon launch s as in the area. All local
                              GA airfields (except Halfpenny Green) reported no night activity on the date of the
                              incident. The activity from Halfpenny Green was police operations that had landed
                              before the
                              incident time. Since the incident occurred in good radar coverage (both Birmingham
                              and
                              Ctee Hill) and no contacts either squawking or
                              primary­ only were evident within 20nm of the incident position, it Is thought most
                              unlikely
                              that the lights emanated from normal GA, other police or air ambulance activity. A
                              laser light show was also discounted since there was no cloud base for the lights
                              to be
                              reflected on. Fireworks or flares were also discounted since the light
                              source did not descend towards the ground as, even with parachute flares, would be
                              the
                              case and, in any case, the lights reported were not bright enough to be
                              pyrotechnics. The authorities for the parks close to1heincident area ware
                              contacted but they had no activity recorded for the evening of <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">06/02/1980</span>. Although the possibility of a civilian clandestine flight by a
                              microlight or similar ac could not be ruled out, it is thought unlikely that any pilot
                              engaged on illegal airborne activity would omit what could probably be identified
                              as a
                              police helicopter. Regrettably therefore, despite extensive tracing the source of the
                              lights could not be identified.  PART B: SUMMARY.OF TKEBOARD'S DISCUSSIONS
                              Information available included reports from the helicopter pilot, a recording of the
                              relevant RT frequency, radar video recordings and a report from the appropriate
                              ATC authorities. The Board noted the extensive
                              tracing action taken by the Secretariat and accepted that any further efforts was
                              unlikely
                              to determine the source of the lights reported by the E:C135 pilot which, despite
                              there
                              being no information to support the crew's (unanimous) sighting, Members accepted
                              totally as
                              being accurate. The Board, which Included a very experienced helicopter pilot Member
                              with
                              extensive experience of civil, military and police helicopter operations, was Invited
                              to
                              offer an explanation as to the source of the lights: none was forthcoming. The possibility
                              of a clandestine flight was only one of several possibilities and Members were not
                              convinced
                              that, other than by exclusion of other logical possibilities. there was _sufficient
                              information to mention this in the cause, Certainly however, the ac from which the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights elumanated had been small and probably non-metallic </span>since It

                              required by the ANO. Members agreed unanimously that they did not have enough information
                              to

                                 circular in shape</span> (e.g. rear end of a uniform, closed cylinder). Location of

                              of witness
                              (aged 25) and interviewer (father): <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">solid craft under control bearing no similarity
                                 to any known terrestrial aircraft</span> and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">exhibiting an ability to
                                 maintain a constant height above the ground at a speed which would not allow any normal
                                 propulsion system or aerodynamic structure to maintain lift</span>, other than such
                              as VSTOL type aircraft and balloons (both definitely ruled out).
                              Definitely not astronomical or meteorological phenomenon. [Sketch of

                           <p> Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
                           <p> Whilst driving along Wolstanton Road, Chesterton, Newcastle Under Lyme at
                              18:32 on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">04/02/2009</span> I
                              noticed an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange light fairly low in the sky</span>. At first I thought it was
                              a street light but then realised that it was too high in the sky. It was a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">dullish
                                 orange colour</span> and what made me think it strange was that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was
                                 approximately 15-20 times larger than a normal star but at the same time not as
                                 bright</span>. I also knew it was not Venus as that is visible in another part
                              of the sky. The<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> object was circular in shape but did not have a defined
                                 edge</span> and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">its surface appeared to have movement or texture much like a
                                 small section of the suns surface but infinately dimmer</span>. I pulled over
                              in my car and pointed the object out to my two children [] and []. [] asked me
                              what it was to which I could only tell her that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it might be a fireball</span> as
                              I had heard of these in the press and [] asked 'what's the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange round thing in
                                 the sky</span>'. I grabbed my mobile phone and tried to take a photo of the
                              object but it did not appear on the photo. I then switched my phone to
                              video camera mode and filmed the object for approx fourty seconds. As I was
                              filming, the object looked as though it was beginning to <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">back away from us whilst
                                 getting slightly higher in the sky and at this same time it was also reducing in
                                 size</span> . <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">When the object reached about half the size it was when we
                                 originally spotted it an aircraft appeared from my right hand side</span> and
                              appeared to be heading in the direction of the object whilst giving it a wide berth.
                              A few
                              seconds later <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the object reduced to a pin point of light and then completely
                                 disappeared from view</span>. On arrival back home I took out my mobile phone
                              and the film I had taken of the object was gone but the photo I had taken remained
                              intact. On viewing the photo the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">ball of light</span> can be clearly
                              seen. There are a number of stars in the photo so establishing wether this object
                              should
                              have been there or not should be easily calculable as there are several points of
                              reference
                              within the photo and the exact time and date is known. Unfortunately I am having problems
                              attaching the photo to this mail at this time.</p>

                           <p>Dear Sir</p>
                           <p> I have just seen six UFOS whilst driving home. I am sure there is a good explanation
                              and
                              would like to check if you had military craft on exercise in the area to this number.
                              At
                              12:31 this evening, approx half an hour ago I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">6 lights almost in an S
                                 shape</span>
                              slowly moving across the sky. I was on the road FROM Humberston (suburb of Cleethorpes) to Tetnoy, North East
                              Lines. I was on the straight just before Tetnoy villaqe when I saw through my cars
                              front
                              window these 6 lights. I’ve never seen anything like them, it just looked very odd.
                              I pulled
                              over and got out to look further. They were moving in formation from West to north
                              east {towards the sea). The conditions were misty in the sky,
                              although at ground level it was clear. Then one of the lights
                              disappeared quickly. I got back into the car to follow the lights and pulled
                              over again further along. Only two lights remained and gradually faded out. I would
                              like to
                              note that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">there was NO sound</span>. I would like this to be anonymous, you are
                              welcome to contact me discreetly but I do not want the media to know of me or my name
                              as I
                              run several businesses and have a reputation to oonsider. I have taken several photographs
                              on my phone but can not examine them or blow them up until I get back into office
                              as I have
                              left cable there. I would appreciate knowing if you had six helicopters in the area
                              at this
                              time or have I seen a genuine UFO formation? </p>

                           <p>I hope that you can help as this isn't a complaint. Like many others my husband and
                              I saw
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">strange objects flying</span> in the south side of
                              glasgow. We were driving on Cathcart Road in Glasgow (think G44 postcode) heading towards the city
                              centre. To our left were what we counted as <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">6 objects, in what to the eye was a
                                 static formation</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Two lines of 3 sitting side by side, one line a
                                 little higher than the other</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">One oject above the other</span>.
                              We turned off the main road to park the car and take photographs.
                              They were now in front of us and we were facing west. We have never in our lives
                              seen objects in the sky like this. Luckily we pulled over where other
                              members of the public had pulled over, along with dog walkers who had congregated
                              in
                              amazement. without managing to take a photo the objects seemed to start moving
                              further away, drawing themselves together to make themselves look like one object
                              and
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it/they it disappeared into the distance</span> heading towards the west.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">At first quick glance they looked like they could have been helicopters but
                                 they definately weren't</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The light that they emitted was very strong
                                 and surrounded each object in full</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was a yellow/orange</span>.
                              The whole sight was so extrodinary that after talking about it for hours we began
                              to doubt
                              ourselves. This is why we're so very glad to have met with other members of the
                              public so that our doubts couldn't be varified. We began to reason that the
                              evert would be in the local news as some sort of Christmas hoax but unfortunatelv
                              we've not
                              heard of anything apart from sightings on the 30th December about 20
                              minutes away by car! We would be most very thankful if you could inform us as to what
                              these
                              could have</p>
                           <p>Many thanks and kind regards,[]</p>

                           <p><span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">03/27/2009</span>at about 4:1Opm
                              in Walthamstow London, Driving home
                              from work I had a sighting. At first I fought I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three white
                                 birds circling in the sky</span>. I soon realised that these were not
                              birds as they were to <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">far away and large</span>. As they circled <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">they
                                 were dipping in and out of the clouds</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">These objects were to fast to
                                 be aeroplanes and continued circling</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">they could have been a light
                                 sources or they could have been reflecting light</span>. Cannot remember exact
                              shape as all happened to quickly. Possible <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> small tail of light
                                 underneath each one at a slight angle away from the direction of the objects
                                 travel</span>. My sighting was breath as I turned a corner and drove through a built
                              up area hoping to catch a glimpse later on my journey but this was not to be. I
                              should have stopped the car to get a better look. Any idea what I might have
                              seen? Have you received any other reports that might tie in with this sighting in
                              terms of
                              time or location.</p>
                           <p> Hope to hear from you Regards</p>
