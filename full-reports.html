               <p>I'm not sure that these were UFOs, but last night on 7
                  February 2009 I saw 2 strange lights in the sky over
                  Basingstoke in Hampshire. At
                  11:1Opm my partner and I noticed a very  bright orange light
                  travelling very fast from North to South East. It was too large and
                  bright to be a plane, it was in view for approx 1 minute then
                  disappeared behind a cloud. We could notice no noise or
                  tail. At 12:10am on 8 February I noticed what appeared to
                  be an extremely bright, white star, where the
                  orange light had originated. The star seemed to fall out of
                  the sky, towards the ground very quickly. It disappeared within
                  seconds. If you happen to know what these lights were and could let me know, I
                  would appreciate it.</p>

               <p> THE EC135 PILOT reports flying a routine night police surveillance task on the edge
                  Birmingham CTR squawking 0060 with Mode
                  C and in receipt of a RC service from them. He was operating around 1500ft on the
                  QNH and
                  initially In an orbit at 80kt when the front observer saw unidentified lights flying
                  around their ac. The pilot established visual contact. He estimated 1OOm away
                  but it was very difficult to tell as he maneuvered to avoid collision and to identify
                  the light source. The lights appeared to continue to Circle their ac the same
                  height, flew to the N slightly then returned. Contact was broken by flying E to Birmingham City and descending to a lower height to
                  enable the lights to be seen against the dark sky, but the other ac
                  returned to their area. They searched the open land in the area below them with their
                  thermal camera looking for any signs of radio-controlled model activity but nothing
                  obvious
                  was found. He believes the lights may have come from a radio-controlled fixed wing
                  ac.the
                  lights being to assist with night flying, and that it was purposely flown around them.
                  He
                  also thought that the intent may either have been sinister. or just someone
                  "'messing around”. He informed Birmingham Radar at the and me who as would be
                  expected saw nothing on the radar. probably due to tile small size of the other ac.
                  ATSI had nothing to add. UKAB Note (1): The
                  pilot of the EC135 was very co-operative and provided additional information when
                  contacted
                  by the Secretariat. He is a very experienced helicopter pilot particularly In night
                  operations. He was engaged on a routine police surveillance task. accompanied
                  by 2 fully trained police observers, one visual in the left hand seat and one the
                  rear
                  operating the ac equipment and,at the time, using NVGs. All 3 crew members saw 2
                  continuous (not flashing} blue/green lights and the front seat observer saw an
                  object behind the lights. The rear seat observer saw the lights on his NVGs but nothing
                  else
                  due to 'blooming'. None of the crew members could offer any explanation as to the
                  source of
                  the lights other than that given by the plot. The RT recording verifies that the ECt35
                  ·
                  pitot reportable the incident to Radar and they responded by saying that there were
                  no other
                  contacts in the area. The pilot discounted any 'flashing· from the rotor blades (as
                  reponed
                  as taking place In some helicopter operations In the Middle East). He also stated
                  that they
                  thought that the source of the lights might be a reflection from the NVG lenses onto
                  the
                  Inside of the ac canopy: this was later discounted alter another ac conducted a test
                  on a
                  later flight. UKAB Note (2): All available radar recordings were examined and Ille
                  EC135
                  shows throL19hout. squawking with Mode C, operating on the edge of the Birmingham
                  CTR, both
                  inside and outside Class D airspace. The RT recording shows that the pilot was in
                  contact
                  with Birmingham Radar and cleared to operate in the area. At the time the only other
                  ac seen
                  in the area and the only other In contact with radar, is a routine Birmingham CAT inbound which passes over the EC135. well
                  above. (Although he did not report seeing lt, the EC135 pilot was certain that the
                  lights did not emanate from that ac). There were several 'one swoop
                  only' primary contacts over 10nm to to W and slightly before the incident time that
                  were
                  attributed to anomalous propagation. UKAS Note (3}: Due to the pilot's report the
                  first
                  organization contacted by the UKAB in attempting to trace the source of the lights
                  was the
                  British Model Flying Association. Their view was
                  that the object could not have been a model ac as it would have been too high and
                  they had
                  no reports of any activity at night. In addition it would not, In their
                  view been possible to control a normal (in size and control system) model ac at that
                  height
                  since any light would not have been sufficient to enable control. In pursuing more
                  sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles, known civil, police and military operators
                  of UAVs
                  were contacted and no activity was reported (in any case it was a most unlikely)
                  location and time for the operation of UAVs, indeed virtually impossible for
                  military UAV activity). Military flights were ruled out since there was
                  no squawk observed and the area is out with the UKLFS.
                  Gliders, kites, tethered and untethered balloons were ruled out due ID the light and
                  weather conditions. There are no Met balloon launch s as in the area. All local
                  GA airfields (except Halfpenny Green) reported no night activity on the date of the
                  incident. The activity from Halfpenny Green was police operations that had landed
                  before the
                  incident time. Since the incident occurred in good radar coverage (both Birmingham
                  and
                  Ctee Hill) and no contacts either squawking or
                  primary­ only were evident within 20nm of the incident position, it Is thought most
                  unlikely
                  that the lights emanated from normal GA, other police or air ambulance activity. A
                  laser light show was also discounted since there was no cloud base for the lights
                  to be
                  reflected on. Fireworks or flares were also discounted since the light
                  source did not descend towards the ground as, even with parachute flares, would be
                  the
                  case and, in any case, the lights reported were not bright enough to be
                  pyrotechnics. The authorities for the parks close to1heincident area ware
                  contacted but they had no activity recorded for the evening of 2 May. Although the possibility of a civilian clandestine flight by a
                  microlight or similar ac could not be ruled out, it is thought unlikely that any pilot
                  engaged on illegal airborne activity would omit what could probably be identified
                  as a
                  police helicopter. Regrettably therefore, despite extensive tracing the source of the
                  lights could not be identified.  PART B: SUMMARY.OF TKEBOARD'S DISCUSSIONS
                  Information available included reports from the helicopter pilot, a recording of the
                  relevant RT frequency, radar video recordings and a report from the appropriate
                  ATC authorities. The Board noted the extensive
                  tracing action taken by the Secretariat and accepted that any further efforts was
                  unlikely
                  to determine the source of the lights reported by the E:C135 pilot which, despite
                  there
                  being no information to support the crew's (unanimous) sighting, Members accepted
                  totally as
                  being accurate. The Board, which Included a very experienced helicopter pilot Member
                  with
                  extensive experience of civil, military and police helicopter operations, was Invited
                  to
                  offer an explanation as to the source of the lights: none was forthcoming. The possibility
                  of a clandestine flight was only one of several possibilities and Members were not
                  convinced
                  that, other than by exclusion of other logical possibilities. there was _sufficient
                  information to mention this in the cause, Certainly however, the ac from which the
                  lights elumanated had been small and probably non-metallic since It
                  was not displayed on either of the radars examined and had not been displaying the
                  lighting
                  required by the ANO. Members agreed unanimously that they did not have enough information
                  to
                  determine a degree of risk involved In the incident PART C; ASSESSMENT OFCAUSE ANORISK

               <p>I suspect they were meteors (do not believe in ET!), however, my
                  Husband, two young children and I all clearly witnessed some very strange lights in
                  the sky over Farleigh/Warlingham, Surrey last night, (Sunday lst March) at approximately 7pm.
                  We were driving home from Selsdon, Surrey, and heading up Farleigh Road towards Warlingham
                  when we spotted three very bright orange lights in the sky. They
                  appeared circular, with no tail that was visible, and were travelling at speed
                  towards the East (approx). They were visible for a good 4-5 minutes very
                  brightly, at which pointed they slowly faded and disappeard one by one. I saw
                  one on it's own first off, which appeared to be just above the tree line ahead, and thought
                  it looked like an orange street lamp, but realised that as we rounded the
                  corner there were two others - they were all high in the sky and together they
                  appeard to be in a triangular formation to start. We pulled over in the
                  entrance to Farleigh Golf Club and watched as they flew over our head before dissapearing.
                  They made no noise, and we could not tell how high they were. Someone
                  pulled over behind us, pressumably to watch too, however, we did not speak to them.
                  Would
                  love to know if these lights have been reported by anyone else and if
                  anyone would know what it was we saw. Why do we never have a camera when we really
                  need one! </p>

               <p> I’m an eve witness who lives near Lyneham
                  Air base in Calne, This Saturday 20th
                  September 2008 myself and many others witnessed UFO activity around
                  10pm In the Calne area. We witnessed 5 super bright glowing
                  orange/pink orbs at low altitude flying above us that had unusual flying characteristic
                  and were totally silent in flight! They were (NOT) flares
                  from Salisbury as could elevate as well as descend Did Air traffic control pick these
                  UFOs
                  up on radar or know what craft they were? I’m convinced these vessels were not military
                  as
                  civilians know of and looked of exterrestrial form even though I’m aware
                  of technology that is hidden from public knowledge! These bright orbs
                  went out of vision as we re-located in an attempt to get a closer viewing and thought
                  we had
                  lost the vessels for good! However less than a minute later we
                  followed a solo flying fireball above us that gradually made its way
                  In the direction of Wootton Bassett climbing altitude until could no longer be
                  seen Again I think this was a craft of some sort and not a comet or weather
                  balloon as x1 it was climbing altitude and travelled to quickly to be
                  a balloon and eventually entered space Again did Air control track this
                  huge fireball that made a right tum above us towards Wootton Bassett? I and others know of Black project
                  coverups controlled by your superiors, as its now leaked over the internet for everyone
                  to
                  see. However If you have information on this sighting you can share, I would appreciate
                  what
                  you could tell me! I have (NOT) reported this to local press as for many would appear
                  a
                  total hoax, plus many may not be conditioned in a way they could accept this Hope

                  in Walthamstow London, Driving home
                  from work I had a sighting. At first I fought I saw three white
                  birds circling in the sky. I soon realised that these were not
                  birds as they were to far away and large. As they circled they
                  were dipping in and out of the clouds. These objects were to fast to
                  be aeroplanes and continued circling. they could have been a light
                  sources or they could have been reflecting light. Cannot remember exact
                  shape as all happened to quickly. Possible  small tail of light
                  underneath each one at a slight angle away from the direction of the objects
                  travel. My sighting was breath as I turned a corner and drove through a built
                  up area hoping to catch a glimpse later on my journey but this was not to be. I
                  should have stopped the car to get a better look. Any idea what I might have
                  seen? Have you received any other reports that might tie in with this sighting in
                  terms of
                  time or location.</p>

                  than one there, usually a pair of them appearing one after another in
                  a distance and difference of heights b/w 'em. hanging in one point
                  still for minutes, then disappearing momentarily. One time a
                  'triangle' formation of near a dozen of those appeared as well, with one of
                  them hanging aside off the triangle ('the admiral ship'). Unfortunately,
                  I was busy looking for fresh batteries for my camera and this was the only sample

                  Sighting of same UFO type on two continents. I want to impress you
                  first with my qualifications for knowing what I saw and secondly for being able to
                  identify
                  that what I saw was not a normal aerial object. For some twenty five years I was in
                  the
                  Army of Great Britain and Australia as a National Serviceman and then as a
                  Territorial Army and Citizens' Military Force Volunteer. My final rank was Captain.
                  In the
                  British Army, my number was [] and my
                  main occupation waws Forward Observer in Field Artillery but I also served in a light
                  Anti-aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery where you served by identification of
                  enemy aircraft in time to take proper action. For more than twenty-five
                  years I studied aircraft recognition as a civilian amateur and as a military
                  professional. From the foregoing I hope that you may realise that I have been
                  trained, have experience and are able to dentify objects, their shape and dimensions
                  at a
                  distance. It may be considered that if I say that I saw something and describe it
                  in detail
                  I did see it and that it did exist at two separate times in separate places on two
                  continents. Early in 2007, I cannot give you the
                  exact date because that did not become important until my second sighting, one morning
                  I was
                  in my front garden in Hawthorn, an inner suburb of
                  Melbourne, Australia. I heard
                  a large jet aeroplane approaching from the east at low level and recognised the sound
                  of a
                  Boeing 747. I got hold of my binoculars, which I keep handy for such occasions, captured
                  the
                  image and followed the plane as it passed slowly from east to west across my front.
                  It was
                  to my north about 1,000 metres from me at as low a level as such planes are permitted
                  to fly
                  across the inner areas of Melbourne, on a line of sight
                  about fifteen degrees of elevation from me, in its sweeping approach to Tullamarine
                  airport
                  gone fifteen kilometres away. The sky was clear cloudless blue. As I
                  scanned back along the fuselage to the white kangaroo on the red tail of the Qadtas
                  jumbo I
                  saw behind and beyond the tail by at least 500 metres an object in the
                  sky. I recall thinking I'll follow the 747 until it goes behind the nearby
                  houses and then come back to the object. It was an unusual shape. The
                  other day I heard a news broadcast which mentioned the UFO desk at MOD in London and as a result I have
                  directed my report to you. If you require any other information, please let me know,
                  otherwise, I do not expect you to expend your valuable time on a reply. </p>

               <p> As you know, OSI has completed a report on the
                  landing of a craft of unknown origin crewed by several entities near
                  RAF Bentwaters on the night of the
                  December 29/30 1980. Interestingly,
                  OSI reports that the entities were
                  approximately 1 ½ meters tall, wearing what appeared to be nylon coated pressure suits,
                  but no helmets. Conditions on the night were misty,
                  giving the appearance that the entities were hovering above ground level. Tape recordings
                  were made on which the entities are heard to speak in an electronically synthesised
                  version
                  of English, with a strong American accent. Similar transmissions intercepted irregularly by
                  ISA(?) since 1973(see attachment- Flag 1). According to OSI, entities had claw-like hands and with three fingers and
                  an opposable thumb. Despite original reports(Flags 3- 0), OSI said the craft was not damaged but landed deliberately as
                  part of a series of visits to SAC bases in USA and Europe. Reports that craft was repaired
                  by US serviceman or was taken on to the base are not confirmed by OSI. Landing is not considered a defence issue in view of the
                  overt peaceful nature of the contact, but investigations by [] are to be
                  continued on [] authority. Precautionary plans for counter-information at a local
                  level
                  involving [] and [] is strongly recommended. </p>

               <p>Please forgive me if I have your information wrong. I have been given advice from
                  a
                  colleague of mine to contact yourself. This was not reported to Police per say but
                  I thought
                  I ought to let you know as I saw it. I have been a serving Police Officer for a
                  number of years now and my Partner Karl Norman who was with me at the time is an
                  ex serviceman in the RAF. I was at my friends address
                  in Brightlingsea, Essex on New
                  Years Eve seeing in the New Year, just before midnight myself and my
                  partner were in the back garden having a cigarette; I could hear fireworks in the
                  distance so looked up to see it I could see them. In the sky was a
                  bright orange/yellow light at first glance I Ignored it thinking it was
                  a trailing firework but then double took as it did not disappear. My immediate
                  thought was we are near water and perhaps that could explain the light
                  but it still did not disappear, it moved very slowly in like a half circle around
                  the top of us then stopped over the water between Brightingsea and East Mersea. It was quite
                  large and the night was extremely clear with no clouds or
                  mist. I would hazard a guess about 1500 to 2000 feet up.
                  It stayed perfectly still for about 3-4 minutes then appeared to shoot straight
                  up in the air very fast, going completely out of view in less then 30 seconds,
                  I must be honest I stood there a bit in awe and missed the start of the new year
                  because of it. In fact I even called my friends daughter to see it! It may be
                  completely trivial to you and you may even press the delete button, but after a few
                  days of
                  wondering whether I was seeing things I saw the news about the Lincoln sightings and
                  damage
                  to the wind turbine I could have fallen off my seat it was very similar to what I
                  saw New
                  years eve. With Karl being ex RAF I asked him quite
                  innocently what it was and he was as disturbed as I was with no answer! I would not
                  have
                  bothered you with it in all honesty but having it play on my mind a few days I thought
                  you
                  were the best people to make the decision about whether it was worth your time or
                  not. If

               <p> I have just seen six UFOS whilst driving home. I am sure there is a good explanation
                  and
                  would like to check if you had military craft on exercise in the area to this number.
                  At
                  12:31 this evening, approx half an hour ago I saw 6 lights almost in an S
                  shape
                  slowly moving across the sky. I was on the road FROM Humberston (suburb of Cleethorpes) to Tetnoy, North East
                  Lines. I was on the straight just before Tetnoy villaqe when I saw through my cars
                  front
                  window these 6 lights. I’ve never seen anything like them, it just looked very odd.
                  I pulled
                  over and got out to look further. They were moving in formation from West to north
                  east {towards the sea). The conditions were misty in the sky,
                  although at ground level it was clear. Then one of the lights
                  disappeared quickly. I got back into the car to follow the lights and pulled
                  over again further along. Only two lights remained and gradually faded out. I would
                  like to
                  note that there was NO sound. I would like this to be anonymous, you are
                  welcome to contact me discreetly but I do not want the media to know of me or my name
                  as I
                  run several businesses and have a reputation to oonsider. I have taken several photographs
                  on my phone but can not examine them or blow them up until I get back into office
                  as I have
                  left cable there. I would appreciate knowing if you had six helicopters in the area
                  at this
                  time or have I seen a genuine UFO formation? </p>

               <p>During the early hours of 15 February 2009 at around
                  00:15hrs i was with my wife and two friends driving through
                  Winwick Warrington. I was
                  driving and sighted two orange lights in the sky which was
                  hovering over the old hospital sight that is now a housing
                  development. The lights were not together but were stationary. We stopped
                  the car and got out to have a look. As we did we saw other people in nearby houses also
                  stood looking at them. There was no noise from them at all. One
                  then began moving and moved away out of sight in a southern direction.
                  The second light stayed in placed and then after around 30 seconds also moved
                  away in the same direction. Again there was no noise.
                  It was out of sight within around 15 seconds. There was definitely
                  something strange about it I am not a real believer in ufos but there is no other
                  explanation. </p>

               <p>I live by Waterloo, London, on a 10th floor
                  flat overlooking a substantial part of the southern part of the city. I have become quite
                  perturbed over the past couple of nights by UFO's, of which I believe that I have seen
                  3 of varying sizes. My profession is of that of a CEO of two
                  companies listed on the stockmarket, so i think myself to be a sensible and sane individual.
                  The sightings involve one object with a white light and alternating red lights at
                  an angle. The object came from south-east London, headed toward
                  Canary Wharf, stopped in mid air, at which
                  point an alternating sequence of red lights flashed at a 180 degree angle
                  with the top light being on the left hand side of the object with the
                  lights moving down toward the bottom right of the angle, before the lights switched
                  side instantaneously and the object went back toward south-east London.
                  Roughly one minute later the object returned in my direction,
                  the red lights continuing to lash alongside it, before it headed
                  north over my apartment and out of sight. My most recent sighting took place at
                  22:52 tonight, 23 February 2009. This sighting occurred for four
                  seconds, and was the flashing of a huge object taking up a portion of the sky the
                  size of which I have never seen before. It appeared to be flying
                  low, and had, as I recall, three lights, of which one I
                  believe was a normal white light, and the other two were green lights.
                  It vanished out of my sight almost immediately, and I was unable to
                  track the lights. If you are able to shed light on either of these two incidents I
                  would be
                  most grateful. I do not proclaim to be an expert in helicopters, but am able to spot one
                  from my window with ease normally.</p>

                  (Tel
                  No: [] ) telephoned the RAF Lyneham ATC Supervisor on
                  Monday, 15 Jun 09 to ask whether we had had any unusual aircraft in the
                  vicinity of Wroughton
                  between 1930 and 200hrs (local) the previous evening (14 Jun 09). I told
                  him that nothing had been seen by the Lyneham controllers and we had had no reports
                  of
                  anything unusual. He told me that he had seen black, disc-shaped objects,
                  50ft in diameter with lights shining from beneath
                  them hovering over crop circles near Barbury Castle (near Wroughton, just
                  south of Junction 15 of the M4). The discs cast shadows beneath them and
                  were captured on two separate video cameras. He asked me to let him know
                  if we discovered anything about the objects.</p>

               <p> The Sun has reported a UFO sighting over Temhill Barracks in Shropshire at about 11pm on 7 June
                  2008. It appears that a number of soldiers saw lights in the sky and made a
                  video which they have passed to the newspaper. They have not made a formal written
                  report on
                  the matter, although they did inform their superiors. The MoD in London became involved when the
                  press office was contacted by the newspaper on 24th June. On 25th June I requested
                  a copy of
                  the video from Media Ops at HQ 5 Div where it had been passed by the unit concerned. It
                  shows a number of lights in the sky. As reported in the paper, the lights change
                  colour and appear square, but this looks like the pixels snag up as the photographer
                  zoomed in. They do not appear to be moving vary quickly. The BBC has reported
                  that at the same time as the alleged incident, a local hotel was lighting off Chinese
                  lanterns and, apparently, the hotel manager thinks the whole UFO story is “highly
                  hilarious”. I do not intend to investigate any further as I think we have our answer and, as
                  I suspect there might be copyright issues surrounding the video, do not intend to
                  retain a
                  copy on our files. I will inform the soldiers of my decision through their 2ic. </p>

               <p> Firstly I must stress that I am one of the world’s biggest sceptics when it come
                  to UFO’s however I can offer no realistic explanation for what I saw, therefore
                  it was literally an unidentified flying object. I was working in the air traffic control
                  at
                  RAF Lyneham in Willshire on night shift. I was the approach
                  controller and supervisor of the shirt. At the time I must have had almost 20 years
                  of
                  working on radar and was very used to analyzing the quirks which a radar can produce
                  such as
                  bird activity, ananprop (atmospheric variation) and MTI suppression. I was recovering
                  a
                  couple of C130’s to base when I saw a large “blob” on the radar screen
                  about 3 miles from touchdown on the center line. I had no idea what it was so I called
                  it to
                  the pilots and fed them around it. The blob was stationary. I handed the
                  aircraft over to the visual controller and then went upstairs to the visual control
                  room
                  where I could see the “blob” on the DFTI (distance from touchdown
                  indicator). I looked through the window but couldn’t see anything, so I returned to
                  the
                  radar room. Suddenly the “blob” burst and fragmented shooting off in all directions
                  at massive speed. Some discussion took place between me and the visual
                  controller and we left it at that. Sometime later I received a phone call from a very
                  agitated airman who said “Sir I have not been drinking, I am on guard duty and
                  have just seen something that was very strange, and I can’t explain but thought the
                  Air
                  traffic controller should be informed of. He said he had seen a bright
                  light to the east I remember commenting that it was nearly Christmas but
                  doubted that we would find 3 wise men or a virgin at Lyneham. He said that the bright light had burst and that fragments
                  had shot in all directions at speeds which he could not believe. He said he
                  had never seen anything travel so fast and it was definitely not an
                  aircraft. His account caused the hairs on my neck to stand up.
                  Several minutes later another airman telephoned and gave a similar
                  account. I logged all the details and telephoned the MOD UFO desk, gave them a
                  verbal report backed up with a written report which hopefully they will still have
                  on
                  record. This happened just before Christmas but I struggle top remember the year.
                  I served
                  at Lyneham in the early to mid 90’s and I
                  guess it would be December of 1994 or 1995. I Think
                  the visual controller was a chap called [] who was a Sergeant at the time because
                  I cannot
                  justify or explain it any better than I have to you. Please call me on my mobile if
                  you
                  would like to discuss it more. [] </p>

               <p> With regards to the the Airprox incident report 055/08 which involved a West Midlands Police helicopter and an unidentified flying
                  object on 2nd May 2008 which shows a very extensive
                  investigation which took place. We are investigating this incident further as we have
                  2 additional Police Officers who experienced an object of a
                  similar nature which had blue lights on the previous night
                  1st May. We also have acquired photographs from an officer which we are trying to
                  confirm is of that particular night. Firstly this incident happened on the 2nd
                  May and involved an object with blue/green lights and was witnessed by a
                  Police helicopter. We are looking for further assistance and a Freedom of Information
                  request on any details relating to this particular event. We are also seeking permission
                  to
                  use details from the Airprox report to further assist us and build part of our final
                  report.

                  Duration: approx. 5 mins. Weather: fine; &gt; 15
                  miles visibility; wind speed - 1 knot; cloudless
                  to horizon; temp. approx. freezing, moon and Jupiter
                  (latter 180 deg. from object) clear / no distortion. Direction of first
                  sighting approx. ENE of witness, last sighting approx. 90 deg. in WNW direction relative
                  to
                  witness position; speed estimated at less than 15mph. Distance to object
                  approx, 1 mile at first sighting and approx. 15 deg. above horizon; object appeared
                  to
                  follow vertical contours of land, ie. gentle undulation, course appeared to be a straight
                  line, i.e. no horizontal deviation apparent. Object was a clearly defined
                  (no diffuse edges), shiny (reflected
                  light only, no evidence of light emission from the object), silvery,
                  metallic cylinder with rounded ends and, when compared to sizes of trees in
                  approx. vicinity of object, was roughly 50 feet in length. No
                  distinguishing features other than a small area in the lower
                  midsection that appeared slightly darker/matt relative to the rest of the body and
                  a
                  small, solid protrusion on the upper rear' body (relative to direction off
                  light) - stated as not looking like an aircraft tail (wrong shape and too small to
                  be an
                  aerodynamic control surface- witness used to civilian and military aircraft
                  types): no markings of any kind and no lights. No
                  sound from object, nor emissions seen (exhaust, etc.), though high
                  flying aircraft could be faintly heard shortly after the sighting in the
                  opposite part of the sky to said sighting and at far greater distance than the object
                  (the
                  witness lives under the main high altitude civilian north-south air route and the
                  low
                  altitude military corridor, sounds from the latter can be heard for many miles, even
                  in
                  windy weather). At last sight it was seen almost from directly behind, remaining
                  shiny/metallic, clearly defined, having no protuberances (no
                  sign of horizontal tail or wing structures- the 'rear' structure seen from the
                  side was sufficiently small/blunt that it barely appeared above the rim of the body),
                  no rear aperlures (exhaust nozzles) and again no signs of
                  exhaust, or atmospheric distortion/turbulance noted: the rear was
                  circular in shape (e.g. rear end of a uniform, closed cylinder). Location of
                  sighting: first seen in the area between Mealrigg (postcode of which is [] and [] and Langrigg and finished by
                  heading through direction of Silloth Cumbria. Witness location was field to SE ( 200
                  yards
                  from house) - interviewer taken to exact site and details pointed out. Conclusion
                  of witness
                  (aged 25) and interviewer (father): solid craft under control bearing no similarity
                  to any known terrestrial aircraft and exhibiting an ability to
                  maintain a constant height above the ground at a speed which would not allow any normal
                  propulsion system or aerodynamic structure to maintain lift, other than such
                  as VSTOL type aircraft and balloons (both definitely ruled out).
                  Definitely not astronomical or meteorological phenomenon. [Sketch of
                  craft provided by witness - side view: height/diameter appears from sketch to be approx.
                  1/5
                  or 1/6 that of the length.] </p>

               <p>On the above heading is what I've seen, spotted over the years some I've takes photo's
                  as
                  well as videos of some from 2007 1st June 20007 and
                  2008 plus others in the past few weeks which I've made it public in the
                  local paper. Some of the UFO'S which you can just make their shape out, but the one
                  I took
                  in 2007 when videoed it took less than 6 of second to enter and disappear when it
                  buzzed this old WWIl tempest plane in the area of Dornock town and Fastriggs,
                  the other outside my back garden when I videoed an RAF jet circling the area several times before I went out with my camera
                  which was a cold cloudy day, when I started to video the jet at the same
                  time this UFO just popped out from behind a cloud going all over the place and back
                  into the clouds them there were others doing the same but only two of them just kept
                  popping in and out of the clouds while the rest just stayed behind thin layers of
                  the
                  clouds I could just make out. All the others were taken by different cameras I
                  have and one that struck me the most of all when I did not have my camera then bat
                  I
                  watched it for about 20 minutes
                  it was all black, no port windows, no strobe lights, no sign of where the engines
                  were as one would on any air craft, no sound at all very quiet, but underneath
                  was what struck me most of all? This UFO, would be about 40/60 feet circular the
                  height from the bottom of the UFO to the top part about 15/20 if no
                  more? Underneath this craft had two different shaped type boxes then all the
                  arca of it had earth military type camouflage we use on all vehicles and
                  planes, it was about 500/1000feet above me and it just look like a
                  giant Frisbee! This was August 1996 Sunday A very clear blue sky it
                  was 1:15pm, once I got home I made a model of it and made a rough birds eye
                  view of it's path as it went over the Solway cost over into England towards the East
                  coast?
                  I keep a kind of record of them so that I can keep track and numbers I've seen and
                  caught on
                  my cameras over the years. I'm not on the internet or other nets, as I can't afford
                  the cost
                  or a decent PC, had do my best with I have, though I have been interested in UFO'S
                  since my
                  school days and would like to know how far back the UK M.O,D., has known of these
                  space
                  crafts that keep popping in and out of our planet buzzing our aircrafts or just floating
                  over at a slow speed which you can pick out all the details but don't disappear or
                  change
                  shape. I had two silver orbs on video one taken at the solway coast and
                  above my house tie latest I got was the last week of May 2009 while photographing
                  two jets
                  going in different directions when I saw 3 large spaceships but managed
                  to get all on my SLR camera but 2of them when blown up look like battle ships from
                  Star Wars Film its on cunning with the shape they are! To me they are the
                  mother of all space crafts I've ever seen. What I hope if possible,
                  of a list of' these crafts since seen and reported in our country to date plus any
                  true
                  videos/films and photos of these crafts as I would like to remake all my cuttings
                  and
                  information of magazines in order of date de lime of year. I'm X- RAF, ARIR and R.O.C. Look forward to hearing from</p>

               <p>I hope that you can help as this isn't a complaint. Like many others my husband and
                  I saw
                  strange objects flying in the south side of
                  glasgow. We were driving on Cathcart Road in Glasgow (think G44 postcode) heading towards the city
                  centre. To our left were what we counted as 6 objects, in what to the eye was a
                  static formation. Two lines of 3 sitting side by side, one line a
                  little higher than the other. One oject above the other.
                  We turned off the main road to park the car and take photographs.
                  They were now in front of us and we were facing west. We have never in our lives
                  seen objects in the sky like this. Luckily we pulled over where other
                  members of the public had pulled over, along with dog walkers who had congregated
                  in
                  amazement. without managing to take a photo the objects seemed to start moving
                  further away, drawing themselves together to make themselves look like one object
                  and
                  it/they it disappeared into the distance heading towards the west.
                  At first quick glance they looked like they could have been helicopters but
                  they definately weren't. The light that they emitted was very strong
                  and surrounded each object in full. It was a yellow/orange.
                  The whole sight was so extrodinary that after talking about it for hours we began
                  to doubt
                  ourselves. This is why we're so very glad to have met with other members of the
                  public so that our doubts couldn't be varified. We began to reason that the
                  evert would be in the local news as some sort of Christmas hoax but unfortunatelv
                  we've not
                  heard of anything apart from sightings on the 30th December about 20
                  minutes away by car! We would be most very thankful if you could inform us as to what
                  these
                  could have</p>

               <p> We spoke, but the following is the basic story: I took a call this morning from the
                  2IC
                  rear part at 1 Royal Irish at Tern Hill
                  Capt[] on [] A soldier who was part of a fire picket stagging on at the camp on 7 June took video footage with a camera on a mobile phone
                  of what he says were "UFOs" in the sky above the camp - which they have
                  emailed to The Sun - and which The Sun is apparently planning on splashing - probably
                  tomorrow. I don't have all the details/timings but what I do have is the following:
                  1.
                  Soldier is Cpl [] who the phone belongs to- he was accompanied by Pte [] who also
                  witnessed
                  the "UFOs". 2. The footage was taken on 7 June at 23.03
                  hrs, - with a 5 megapixel camera on the phone. 3. 2IC rear party says the
                  video images are very good. 4. The 2IC says the images could not have been anything
                  to do
                  with nearby RAF Shawbury. 5. They show lots of
                  multi-coloured dots and zoom in on a cube shaped object which then
                  flattens. 6. The Sun has already interviewed Cpl [] - he has explained to them
                  what he saw. 7. There is some suggestion of payment being offered - thought I think
                  a
                  discussion about that has still to happen. 8. I have reminded all, the 2IC and Cpl
                  [] about
                  their responsibilities ref the DIN on communicating with the media. 9. Cpl [] spoke
                  to [] an
                  editor at The Sun (?) 10.Cpl [] mobile number is [] 11.I spoke to the CRO at RAF Shawbury who said he was not aware - Sqn Ldr [] [] []

               <p> I am writing to tell you what I really saw. In October
                  1992 me and my 2 friends were in a town called Witchurch []. We were parked up for about an
                  hour got out of the Datsun cherry car walked around the
                  corner 3 mins away no sound listening 4 sounds because we were up to no good. Whent
                  back to
                  the car it was gone me and my 2 mates who can conferm this true story I am telling.
                  The car
                  had gone the day in back seats gone and my tent, as we were all baffled by what was
                  happening all of us in dis-belife. Where does the car go no sound just
                  round corner 3 mins and gone vanished. Walking down a long road and
                  all 3 saw [] I said look Boys what the fuck is that in dis-belief. I said look
                  pink flamingos flying south for summer, [] gigging me mate. Said
                  their fire flies I giggled with my mate. My other mate said nothing. Their
                  were about 12-15 flying objects in the sky they were in
                  formation of a triangle. I hear no sounds we see
                  then cross past us about 1 mins then we all walked home to [] diagram what I and.

               <p> Whilst driving along Wolstanton Road, Chesterton, Newcastle Under Lyme at
                  18:32 on 04/02/2009 I
                  noticed an orange light fairly low in the sky. At first I thought it was
                  a street light but then realised that it was too high in the sky. It was a dullish
                  orange colour and what made me think it strange was that it was
                  approximately 15-20 times larger than a normal star but at the same time not as
                  bright. I also knew it was not Venus as that is visible in another part
                  of the sky. The object was circular in shape but did not have a defined
                  edge and its surface appeared to have movement or texture much like a
                  small section of the suns surface but infinately dimmer. I pulled over
                  in my car and pointed the object out to my two children [] and []. [] asked me
                  what it was to which I could only tell her that it might be a fireball as
                  I had heard of these in the press and [] asked 'what's the orange round thing in
                  the sky'. I grabbed my mobile phone and tried to take a photo of the
                  object but it did not appear on the photo. I then switched my phone to
                  video camera mode and filmed the object for approx fourty seconds. As I was
                  filming, the object looked as though it was beginning to back away from us whilst
                  getting slightly higher in the sky and at this same time it was also reducing in
                  size . When the object reached about half the size it was when we
                  originally spotted it an aircraft appeared from my right hand side and
                  appeared to be heading in the direction of the object whilst giving it a wide berth.
                  A few
                  seconds later the object reduced to a pin point of light and then completely
                  disappeared from view. On arrival back home I took out my mobile phone
                  and the film I had taken of the object was gone but the photo I had taken remained
                  intact. On viewing the photo the ball of light can be clearly
                  seen. There are a number of stars in the photo so establishing wether this object
                  should
                  have been there or not should be easily calculable as there are several points of
                  reference
                  within the photo and the exact time and date is known. Unfortunately I am having problems
                  attaching the photo to this mail at this time.</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
               <p>I'm sure you must get so many reports of UFOs, but I thought you might be interested
                  in my
                  experience tonight I can't quite believe what I saw tonight, but it made me rush out
                  onto
                  the street camera in hand. I was very sober when I saw what I am about to describe.
                  Until
                  recently I was a journalist and we used to get similar stories like this from time
                  to time
                  which we would all have a good laugh at (not any more!) I was sitting on the couch
                  when I
                  saw an orange light in the sky. My initial thoughts were 'that
                  plane is flying low· and I went back to watching TV. However, five/ten minutes
                  or so later I couldn't believe it when I saw several orange lights -
                  about the same colour and brightness of street lights -
                  about half a dozen in total. Three of them were closer
                  together than the others and were in a straight, but horizontal line.
                  I shouted upstairs to my boyfriend, who also witnessed the incident. I then
                  told him I was getting the camera before running outside -with no shoes on (the neighbours
                  must think I'm mad). Unfortunately my camera is not great, but I have attached the
                  pictures
                  anyway in the hope you can enhance them. On the one marked UFO 001 you can see a
                  round shape, which was not visible to the naked eye and only appeared when I
                  blew up the photo. I believe it may show the three lights in a horizontal
                  line I described earlier. The whole incident could have only happened
                  over a couple of minutes, maybe less. The lights seemed to fade away, except one
                  which I saw go behind some houses and I followed it a short way down the street on
                  foot
                  before it also disappeared. The incident happened around 9:20pm today
                  (Saturday 11 April. 2009). I live in a village
                  called which is in Chesterfield,
                  Derbyshire. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else saw what I
                  have described and if any explanation can be given.</p>

                  Drickie traveling towards Lancaster and captured something flying
                  in the sky above a grassy ridge. I was using a canon 7-million-pixel digital
                  camera. I saw the craft hovering for a few minutes and was able to take
                  this snap. Whlist waiting for the camera to a cock itself for the next frame, the
                  craft took off vertically at an amazing velocity. The craft, however,
                  was unfortunately in the shadow of a cloud and cannot be seer to cast a

               <p>Anyway, with reference to what I saw on my trip to Gatwick on
                  Monday
                  1st September 2008, here is my account of what took
                  place. I was en route to collect my neighbour's wife and children from her return
                  trip from Toronto. Her time of arrival was 11am, I was
                  advised by my neighbour that I should plan to be there about 11.30am, although I wanted
                  to
                  be a little earlier on arrival for parking and a coffee, but found myself running
                  late after
                  getting to grips with a new Satellite Navigation system and moments of slow motorway
                  traffic. At about 11.05am I was still travelling south, somewhere from the M25 to
                  the M23. I
                  would have to provide a 'guesstimate' of my rough location after tracing my route
                  and being
                  some 20-25 mlnutes away from Gatwick Airport
                  Itself and on the M23 southbound. Because I was working with a brand new Sat Nav system
                  I
                  could not immediately Identify my spot location from the map vlew (I had a Navman
                  which was
                  in a planned route mode and gave a limited vlew of where I was). But I think I was
                  on the
                  M23 not too far from the M25 junction. It was raining to some degree, I
                  had my windscreen wipers operated and car windscreen was clean and without mist with
                  car
                  air-con functional (I drive a Volvo V70). I was in the central lane paying attention
                  to
                  driving hazards and traffic progression (this being skills learnt from the Institute
                  Advanced Motorists standards and police driving standards), basically scanning from
                  horizon
                  to car bonnet and back to horizon taking into account all traffic and it's local
                  environment. times I would glance in to the sky to try to get vlew of flights in bound
                  to
                  Gatwick and an idea of my closeness to destination. It was at this point soon after
                  I saw
                  a flash and bright light in the sky and Immediately associated it
                  with a plane or helicopter (where I live in Waltham Abbey gives a regular view of
                  commercial
                  type flights and helicopter flights as a Met police helicopter landing site is near
                  my house
                  about 1 mile. I walted to identify either a jet plane or helicopter. The bright
                  light stopped and (I expected to see the plane or helicopter) allowed a side
                  profile to be viewed as the air-borne vehicle travelled from left to
                  right. At all times I continued to have casual peripheral vision on the
                  motorway traffic which was continuous and regular. I continued to watch the sky not
                  thinking
                  anything unusual and then this oval shaped object (I now realise it could
                  only match a helicopter in it's side profile was missing it's rear tail),
                  accelerated at a colossal speed, faster than any aircraft I have or been aware
                  of accelerating before and base this on attending airshows a s a child and
                  even seelng jet fighters fly over my junlor school when a child in Loughton, Essex
                  on the
                  1970's which included the sound boom. This unusual oval shaped Ariel vehicle, after
                  accelerating, just vanished out of view.
                  it was quite small in size and appeared to be below cloud cover, but I
                  cannot say categorically. Until It disappeared it was constant and visible and perhaps
                  1mile
                  away, but this is hard to say. Overall, this incident lasted for about 5- 10
                  seconds. Once it had disappeared, I had limited time to re-assess it's location
                  as my road position changed and meant I had to look to my right and through my driver's
                  door
                  window. I have not reported this to MOD, for a
                  limited information feedback reason, I have been aware of such matters in the past
                  as I have
                  pald casual attention to this interest since the mid 1990's (during my time in the
                  Met Police) and relevant book releases and
                  programmes.</p>

                  OLD LIVING WITH MY PARENTS IN BARKING ESSEX. I WORKED IN LONDON AND IN ORDER TO AND IN THE COMMUTER QUES FOR TRAIN TICKETS IN THE
                  MORINNG, I USED TO PURCHASE MY WORKMANS TICKET THE EVEINNG BEFORE AT BARKING
                  RAILWAY STATION, ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENINNG, WALKING FROM MY HOUSE IN
                  SOMERSY ROAD INTO SALISURY ROAD TOWARDS BARKING BEATON I SAW IN THE SKY A LARGE
                  SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT (WITH COLORED LIGHTS ALL AROUND IT’S SIDE) SPINNING AROUND AND
                  HOVERING ABOVE BARKING
