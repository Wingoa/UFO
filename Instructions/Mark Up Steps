I've made up a rough draft for the schema.

It's definitely going to need updated as we mark up additional reports, but it's something to

base the next ones off of.

As we need stuff just add it to the schema as long as it won't break any of the old reports.




Also: 

Files that contain a "D" mean they are done in whatever folder they are in.

If they have a "H", that means there needs to be some manual work completed

such as manually typing a .pdf report into a .doc file.
