            As you know, OSI has completed a report on the 
            landing of a craft of unknown origin crewed by several entities near 
            RAF Bentwaters on the night of the 
            December 29/30 1980.
            Interestingly, OSI reports that the 
            entities were approximately 1 ½ meters tall, wearing what appeared to be nylon coated
            pressure suits, but no helmets. Conditions on the night
            were misty, giving the appearance that the entities were hovering above ground level. Tape
            recordings were made on which the entities are heard to speak in an electronically
            synthesised version of English, with a strong American accent. Similar transmissions
            intercepted irregularly by ISA(?) since 1973(see attachment- Flag 1). According to
            OSI,
            entities had claw-like hands and with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite original
            reports(Flags 3- 0), OSI said the craft was not damaged but landed deliberately as part of a
            series of visits to SAC bases in USA and Europe. Reports that craft was repaired by
            US
            serviceman or was taken on to the base are not confirmed by OSI. Landing is not considered a
            defence issue in view of the overt peaceful nature of the contact, but investigations byXXX
            are to be continued onXXX authority. Precautionary plans for counter-information at
            a local
            level involvingXXX and aXXXXXXXXX is strongly recommended.

            We spoke, but the following is the basic story:
            
            I took a call this morning from the 2IC rear part at 1 Royal Irish at Tern Hill Capt[] on []
            
            A soldier who was part of a fire picket stagging on at the camp on 7 June took 
            video footage with a camera on a mobile phone of what he says were "UFOs"
            in the sky above the camp - which they have emailed to The Sun - and which 
            The Sun is apparently planning on splashing - probably tomorrow.
            
            I don't have all the details/timings but what I do have is the following:
            
            1. Soldier is Cpl [] who the phone belongs to- he was 
            accompanied by Pte [] who also witnessed the "UFOs".
            2. The footage was taken on 7 June at 23.03 hrs, - with a 5 megapixel
            camera on the phone.
            3. 2IC rear party says the video images are very good.
            4. The 2IC says the images could not have been anything to do with
            nearby RAF Shawbury.
            5. They show lots of multi-coloured dots and zoom in on a cube shaped
            object which then flattens.
            6. The Sun has already interviewed Cpl [] - he has explained to
            them what he saw.
            7. There is some suggestion of payment being offered - thought I think a 
            discussion about that has still to happen.
            8. I have reminded all, the 2IC and Cpl [] about their responsibilities
            ref the DIN on communicating with the media.
            9. Cpl [] spoke to [] an editor at The Sun (?)
            10.Cpl [] mobile number is []
            11.I spoke to the CRO at RAF Shawbury who said he was not aware -

            The Sun has reported a UFO sighting over Temhill Barracks in Shropshire at about 11pm on 7 June 2008. It
            appears that a number of soldiers saw lights in the sky and made a video which they
            have passed to the
            newspaper. They have not made a formal written report on the matter, although they
            did inform their
            superiors.
            
            The MoD in London became involved when the press office was contacted by the newspaper on 24th June.
            On 25th June I requested a copy of the video from Media Ops at HQ 5 Div where it had
            been passed by the
            unit concerned. It shows a number of lights in the sky. As reported in the paper,
            the lights change colour and
            appear square, but this looks like the pixels snag up as the photographer zoomed in.
            They do not appear
            to be moving vary quickly.
            
            The BBC has reported that at the same time as the alleged incident, a Iocal hotel
            was jefting off Chinese
            lanterns and, apparently, the hotel manager thinks the whole UFO story is “highly
            hilarious”.
            
            I do not intend to investigate any further as I think we have our answer and, as I
            suspect there might be
            copyright issues surrounding the video, do not intend to retain a copy on our files.
            
            I will inform the soldiers of my decision through their 2ic.

            With regards to the the Airprox incident report 055/08 which involved a West Midlands
            Police helicopter and
            an unidentified flying object on 2nd May 2008 which shows a very extensive investigation which took place.
            
            We are investigating this incident further as we have 2 additional Police Officers
            who experienced an object of
            a similar nature which had blue lights on the previous night 1st May.
            We also have acquired photographs from an officer which we are trying to confirm is
            of that particular night.
            Firstly this incident happened on the 2nd May and involved an object with blue/green lights and was 
            witnessed by a Police helicopter.
            
            We are looking for further assistance and a Freedom of Information request on any
            details relating to this
            particular event. We are also seeking permission to use details from the Airprox report
            to further assist us and
            build part of our final report.
            
            Please feel free to contact me with any issues or information
            
            Thank you for your time

         <p> THE EC135 PILOT reports flying a routine night police surveillance task on the edge
            Birmingham CTR squawking 0060 with Mode C and in
            receipt of a RC service from them. He was operating around 1500ft on the QNH and initially
            In an orbit at 80kt when the front observer saw unidentified lights flying around their ac.
            The pilot established visual contact. He estimated 1OOm away but it was very difficult
            to
            tell as he maneuvered to avoid collision and to identify the light source. The lights
            appeared to continue to Circle their ac the same height, flew to the N slightly then
            returned. Contact was broken by flying E to Birmingham City and descending to a lower height
            to enable the lights to be seen against the dark sky, but the other ac returned to their
            area. They searched the open land in the area below them with their thermal camera
            looking
            for any signs of radio-controlled model activity but nothing obvious was found. He
            believes
            the lights may have come from a radio-controlled fixed wing ac.the lights being to
            assist
            with night flying, and that it was purposely flown around them. He also thought that
            the
            intent may either have been sinister. or just someone "'messing around”. He informed
            Birmingham Radar at the and me who as would be expected saw nothing on the radar.
            probably
            due to tile small size of the other ac. ATSI had nothing to add. UKAB Note (1): The pilot of
            the EC135 was very co-operative and provided additional information when contacted
            by the
            Secretariat. He is a very experienced helicopter pilot particularly In night operations. He
            was engaged on a routine police surveillance task. accompanied by 2 fully trained
            police
            observers, one visual in the left hand seat and one the rear operating the ac equipment
            and,at the time, using NVGs. All 3 crew members saw 2 continuous (not flashing} blue/green
            lights and the front seat observer saw an object behind the lights. The rear seat observer
            saw the lights on his NVGs but nothing else due to 'blooming'. None of the crew members
            could offer any explanation as to the source of the lights other than that given by
            the
            plot. The RT recording verifies that the ECt35 · pitot reportable the incident to
            Radar and
            they responded by saying that there were no other contacts in the area. The pilot
            discounted
            any 'flashing· from the rotor blades (as reponed as taking place In some helicopter
            operations In the Middle East). He also stated that they thought that the source of
            the
            lights might be a reflection from the NVG lenses onto the Inside of the ac canopy:
            this was
            later discounted alter another ac conducted a test on a later flight. 
            
            UKAB Note (2): All
            available radar recordings were examined and Ille EC135 shows throL19hout. squawking
            with
            Mode C, operating on the edge of the Birmingham CTR, both inside and outside Class
            D
            airspace. The RT recording shows that the pilot was in contact with Birmingham Radar
            and
            cleared to operate in the area. At the time the only other ac seen in the area and
            the only
            other In contact with radar, is a routine Birmingham CAT inbound which passes over the
            EC135. well above. (Although he did not report seeing lt, the EC135 pilot was certain
            that
            the lights did not emanate from that ac). There were several 'one swoop only' primary
            contacts over 10nm to to W and slightly before the incident time that were attributed
            to
            anomalous propagation. 
            
            UKAS Note (3}: Due to the pilot's report the first organization
            contacted by the UKAB in attempting to trace the source of the lights was the British Model
            Flying Association. Their view was that the object could not have been a model ac as it
            would have been too high and they had no reports of any activity at night. In addition it
            would not, In their view been possible to control a normal (in size and control system)
            model ac at that height since any light would not have been sufficient to enable control.
            In
            pursuing more sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles, known civil, police and military
            operators of UAVs were contacted and no activity was reported (in any case it was
            a most
            unlikely) location and time for the operation of UAVs, indeed virtually impossible for
            military UAV activity). Military flights were ruled out since there was no squawk observed
            and the area is out with the UKLFS. Gliders, kites, tethered and untethered balloons were
            ruled out due ID the light and weather conditions. There are no Met balloon launch s as in
            the area. All local GA airfields (except Halfpenny Green) reported no night activity
            on the
            date of the incident. The activity from Halfpenny Green was police operations that
            had
            landed before the incident time. Since the incident occurred in good radar coverage
            (both
            Birmingham and Ctee Hill) and no contacts either squawking or primary­ only were evident
            within 20nm of the incident position, it Is thought most unlikely that the lights
            emanated
            from normal GA, other police or air ambulance activity. A laser light show was also
            discounted since there was no cloud base for the lights to be reflected on. Fireworks or
            flares were also discounted since the light source did not descend towards the ground
            as,
            even with parachute flares, would be the case and, in any case, the lights reported
            were not
            bright enough to be pyrotechnics. The authorities for the parks close to1heincident area
            ware contacted but they had no activity recorded for the evening of 2 May. Although the
            possibility of a civilian clandestine flight by a microlight or similar ac could not
            be
            ruled out, it is thought unlikely that any pilot engaged on illegal airborne activity
            would
            omit what could probably be identified as a police helicopter. Regrettably therefore,
            despite extensive tracing the source of the lights could not be identified. 
            
            PART B:
            
            SUMMARY.OF TKEBOARD'S DISCUSSIONS Information available included reports from the
            helicopter
            pilot, a recording of the relevant RT frequency, radar video recordings and a report
            from
            the appropriate ATC authorities. The Board noted the extensive tracing action taken by the
            Secretariat and accepted that any further efforts was unlikely to determine the source
            of
            the lights reported by the E:C135 pilot which, despite there being no information
            to support
            the crew's (unanimous) sighting, Members accepted totally as being accurate. The Board,
            which Included a very experienced helicopter pilot Member with extensive experience
            of
            civil, military and police helicopter operations, was Invited to offer an explanation
            as to
            the source of the lights: none was forthcoming. The possibility of a clandestine flight
            was
            only one of several possibilities and Members were not convinced that, other than
            by
            exclusion of other logical possibilities. there was _sufficient information to mention
            this
            in the cause, Certainly however, the ac from which the lights elumanated had been small and
            probably non-metallic since It was not displayed on either of the radars examined and had
            not been displaying the lighting required by the ANO. Members agreed unanimously that
            they
            did not have enough information to determine a degree of risk involved In the incident
            PART
            C; ASSESSMENT OFCAUSE ANORISK Cause: An apparent conflict with an unidentified ac
            displaying
            non-standard lights. Degree of Risk: D. </p>

            Sighting of same UFO type on two continents.
            
            I want to impress you first with my qualifications for knowing 
            what I saw and secondly for being able to identify that what 
            I saw was not a normal aerial object.
            
            For some twenty five years I was in the Army of Great Britain
            and Australia as a National Serviceman and then as a Territorial
            Army and Citizens' Military Force Volunteer. My final rank was 
            Captain. In the British Army, my number was [] and my main 
            occupation waws Forward Observer in Field Artillery but I also 
            served in a light Anti-aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery
            where you served by identification of enemy aircraft in time
            to take proper action. For more than twenty-five years I studied
            aircraft recognition as a civilian amateur and as a military
            professional.
            
            From the foregoing I hope that you may realise that I have
            been trained, have experience and are able to dentify objects,
            their shape and dimensions at a distance. It may be considered
            that if I say that I saw something and describe it in detail
            I did see it and that it did exist at two separate times in
            separate places on two continents.
            
            Early in 2007, I cannot give you the exact date because that
            did not become important until my second sighting, one morning
            I was in my front garden in Hawthorn, an inner suburb of
            Melbourne, Australia. I heard a large jet aeroplane approaching
            from the east at low level and recognised the sound of a Boeing
            747. I got hold of my binoculars, which I keep handy for such
            occasions, captured the image and followed the plane as it passed
            slowly from east to west across my front. It was to my north 
            about 1,000 metres from me at as low a level as such planes
            are permitted to fly across the inner areas of Melbourne, on
            a line of sight about fifteen degrees of elevation from me,
            in its sweeping approach to Tullamarine airport gone fifteen
            kilometres away. The sky was clear cloudless blue. 
            
            As I scanned back along the fuselage to the white kangaroo
            on the red tail of the Qadtas jumbo I saw behind and beyond
            the tail by at least 500 metres an object in the sky. I recall
            thinking I'll follow the 747 until it goes behind the nearby
            houses and then come back to the object. It was an unusual shape.
            
            The other day I heard a news broadcast which mentioned the 
            UFO desk at MOD in London and as a result I have directed my report to you.
            
            If you require any other information, please let me know,
            otherwise, I do not expect you to expend your valuable time on 
            a reply. 
            
            </p>
         <h2>2452_pg156</h2>
         <p> Firstly I must stress that I am one of the world’s biggest sceptics when it come
            to UFO’s however I can offer no realistic explanation for what I saw, therefore
            it was literally an unidentified flying object. I was working in the air traffic control
            at
            RAF Lyneham in Willshire on night shift. I was the approach
            controller and supervisor of the shirt. At the time I must have had almost 20 years
            of
            working on radar and was very used to analyzing the quirks which a radar can produce
            such as
            bird activity, ananprop (atmospheric variation) and MTI suppression. I was recovering
            a
            couple of C130’s to base when I saw a large “blob” on the radar screen
            about 3 miles from touchdown on the center line. I had no idea what it was so I called
            it to
            the pilots and fed them around it. The blob was stationary. I handed the
            aircraft over to the visual controller and then went upstairs to the visual control
            room
            where I could see the “blob” on the DFTI (distance from touchdown
            indicator). I looked through the window but couldn’t see anything, so I returned to
            the
            radar room. Suddenly the “blob” burst and fragmented shooting off in all directions
            at massive speed. Some discussion took place between me and the visual
            controller and we left it at that. Sometime later I received a phone call from a very
            agitated airman who said “Sir I have not been drinking, I am on guard duty and
            have just seen something that was very strange, and I can’t explain but thought the
            Air
            traffic controller should be informed of. He said he had seen a bright
            light to the east I remember commenting that it was nearly Christmas but
            doubted that we would find 3 wise men or a virgin at Lyneham. He said that the bright light had burst and that fragments
            had shot in all directions at speeds which he could not believe. He said he
            had never seen anything travel so fast and it was definitely not an
            aircraft. His account caused the hairs on my neck to stand up.
            Several minutes later another airman telephoned and gave a similar
            account. I logged all the details and telephoned the MOD UFO desk, gave them a
            verbal report backed up with a written report which hopefully they will still have
            on
            record. This happened just before Christmas but I struggle top remember the year.
            I served
            at Lyneham in the early to mid 90’s and I
            guess it would be December of 1994 or 1995. I Think
            the visual controller was a chap called [] who was a Sergeant at the time because
            I cannot
            justify or explain it any better than I have to you. Please call me on my mobile if
            you
            would like to discuss it more. [] </p>
         <h2>2452_pg6</h2>
         <p> I have just seen six UFOS whilst driving home. I am sure there is a good explanation
            and
            would like to check if you had military craft on exercise in the area to this number.
            At
            12:31 this evening, approx half an hour ago I saw 6 lights almost in an S
            shape
            slowly moving across the sky. I was on the road FROM Humberston (suburb of Cleethorpes) to Tetnoy, North East
            Lines. I was on the straight just before Tetnoy villaqe when I saw through my cars
            front
            window these 6 lights. I’ve never seen anything like them, it just looked very odd.
            I pulled
            over and got out to look further. They were moving in formation from West to north
            east {towards the sea). The conditions were misty in the sky,
            although at ground level it was clear. Then one of the lights
            disappeared quickly. I got back into the car to follow the lights and pulled
            over again further along. Only two lights remained and gradually faded out. I would
            like to
            note that there was NO sound. I would like this to be anonymous, you are
            welcome to contact me discreetly but I do not want the media to know of me or my name
            as I
            run several businesses and have a reputation to oonsider. I have taken several photographs
            on my phone but can not examine them or blow them up until I get back into office
            as I have
            left cable there. I would appreciate knowing if you had six helicopters in the area
            at this
            time or have I seen a genuine UFO formation? </p>
         <h2>2452_pg71</h2>
         <p>This is an object that appeared South-East to Kfar-Saba, Israel, on Aug-12,
            2009, circ 9-10pm. Most of time there were more
            than one there, usually a pair of them appearing one after another in
            a distance and difference of heights b/w 'em. hanging in one point
            still for minutes, then disappearing momentarily. One time a
            'triangle' formation of near a dozen of those appeared as well, with one of
            them hanging aside off the triangle ('the admiral ship'). Unfortunately,
            I was busy looking for fresh batteries for my camera and this was the only sample
            capture I was able to take until the camera died. The object was
            perfectly still, all the movements while zoomed-in are due to my hands'
            shaking. Please comment if you have something smart to contribute to enlightening
            the
            phenomena.</p>
         <h2>2454_pg246</h2>
         <p>Please forgive me if I have your information wrong. I have been given advice from
            a
            colleague of mine to contact yourself. This was not reported to Police per say but
            I thought
            I ought to let you know as I saw it. I have been a serving Police Officer for a
            number of years now and my Partner Karl Norman who was with me at the time is an
            ex serviceman in the RAF. I was at my friends address
            in Brightlingsea, Essex on New
            Years Eve seeing in the New Year, just before midnight myself and my
            partner were in the back garden having a cigarette; I could hear fireworks in the
            distance so looked up to see it I could see them. In the sky was a
            bright orange/yellow light at first glance I Ignored it thinking it was
            a trailing firework but then double took as it did not disappear. My immediate
            thought was we are near water and perhaps that could explain the light
            but it still did not disappear, it moved very slowly in like a half circle around
            the top of us then stopped over the water between Brightingsea and East Mersea. It was quite
            large and the night was extremely clear with no clouds or
            mist. I would hazard a guess about 1500 to 2000 feet up.
            It stayed perfectly still for about 3-4 minutes then appeared to shoot straight
            up in the air very fast, going completely out of view in less then 30 seconds,
            I must be honest I stood there a bit in awe and missed the start of the new year
            because of it. In fact I even called my friends daughter to see it! It may be
            completely trivial to you and you may even press the delete button, but after a few
            days of
            wondering whether I was seeing things I saw the news about the Lincoln sightings and
            damage
            to the wind turbine I could have fallen off my seat it was very similar to what I
            saw New
            years eve. With Karl being ex RAF I asked him quite
            innocently what it was and he was as disturbed as I was with no answer! I would not
            have
            bothered you with it in all honesty but having it play on my mind a few days I thought
            you
            were the best people to make the decision about whether it was worth your time or
            not. If
            you have any questions or queries I will be happy to assist in any way possible. My

         <h2>2456_pg234</h2>
         <p>On the above heading is what I've seen, spotted over the years some I've takes photo's
            as
            well as videos of some from 2007 1st June 20007 and
            2008 plus others in the past few weeks which I've made it public in the
            local paper. Some of the UFO'S which you can just make their shape out, but the one
            I took
            in 2007 when videoed it took less than 6 of second to enter and disappear when it
            buzzed this old WWIl tempest plane in the area of Dornock town and Fastriggs,
            the other outside my back garden when I videoed an RAF jet circling the area several times before I went out with my camera
            which was a cold cloudy day, when I started to video the jet at the same
            time this UFO just popped out from behind a cloud going all over the place and back
            into the clouds them there were others doing the same but only two of them just kept
            popping in and out of the clouds while the rest just stayed behind thin layers of
            the
            clouds I could just make out. All the others were taken by different cameras I
            have and one that struck me the most of all when I did not have my camera then bat
            I
            watched it for about 20 minutes
            it was all black, no port windows, no strobe lights, no sign of where the engines
            were as one would on any air craft, no sound at all very quiet, but underneath
            was what struck me most of all? This UFO, would be about 40/60 feet circular the
            height from the bottom of the UFO to the top part about 15/20 if no
            more? Underneath this craft had two different shaped type boxes then all the
            arca of it had earth military type camouflage we use on all vehicles and
            planes, it was about 500/1000feet above me and it just look like a
            giant Frisbee! This was August 1996 Sunday A very clear blue sky it
            was 1:15pm, once I got home I made a model of it and made a rough birds eye
            view of it's path as it went over the Solway cost over into England towards the East
            coast?
            I keep a kind of record of them so that I can keep track and numbers I've seen and
            caught on
            my cameras over the years. I'm not on the internet or other nets, as I can't afford
            the cost
            or a decent PC, had do my best with I have, though I have been interested in UFO'S
            since my
            school days and would like to know how far back the UK M.O,D., has known of these
            space
            crafts that keep popping in and out of our planet buzzing our aircrafts or just floating
            over at a slow speed which you can pick out all the details but don't disappear or
            change
            shape. I had two silver orbs on video one taken at the solway coast and
            above my house tie latest I got was the last week of May 2009 while photographing
            two jets
            going in different directions when I saw 3 large spaceships but managed
            to get all on my SLR camera but 2of them when blown up look like battle ships from
            Star Wars Film its on cunning with the shape they are! To me they are the
            mother of all space crafts I've ever seen. What I hope if possible,
            of a list of' these crafts since seen and reported in our country to date plus any
            true
            videos/films and photos of these crafts as I would like to remake all my cuttings
            and
            information of magazines in order of date de lime of year. I'm X- RAF, ARIR and R.O.C. Look forward to hearing from</p>
         <h2>2626_pg153</h2>
         <p> I’m an eve witness who lives near Lyneham
            Air base in Calne, This Saturday 20th
            September 2008 myself and many others witnessed UFO activity around
            10pm In the Calne area. We witnessed 5 super bright glowing
            orange/pink orbs at low altitude flying above us that had unusual flying characteristic
            and were totally silent in flight! They were (NOT) flares
            from Salisbury as could elevate as well as descend Did Air traffic control pick these
            UFOs
            up on radar or know what craft they were? I’m convinced these vessels were not military
            as
            civilians know of and looked of exterrestrial form even though I’m aware
            of technology that is hidden from public knowledge! These bright orbs
            went out of vision as we re-located in an attempt to get a closer viewing and thought
            we had
            lost the vessels for good! However less than a minute later we
            followed a solo flying fireball above us that gradually made its way
            In the direction of Wootton Bassett climbing altitude until could no longer be
            seen Again I think this was a craft of some sort and not a comet or weather
            balloon as x1 it was climbing altitude and travelled to quickly to be
            a balloon and eventually entered space Again did Air control track this
            huge fireball that made a right tum above us towards Wootton Bassett? I and others know of Black project
            coverups controlled by your superiors, as its now leaked over the internet for everyone
            to
            see. However If you have information on this sighting you can share, I would appreciate
            what
            you could tell me! I have (NOT) reported this to local press as for many would appear
            a
            total hoax, plus many may not be conditioned in a way they could accept this Hope
            to hear
            back, </p>

         <p>This photograph was taken by myself on Sunday the 27th of
            August 2006, in the Trough of Bowland, Lancashire about 3 miles from Dunsop
            Drickie traveling towards Lancaster and captured something flying
            in the sky above a grassy ridge. I was using a canon 7-million-pixel digital
            camera. I saw the craft hovering for a few minutes and was able to take
            this snap. Whlist waiting for the camera to a cock itself for the next frame, the
            craft took off vertically at an amazing velocity. The craft, however,
            was unfortunately in the shadow of a cloud and cannot be seer to cast a
            shadow. I have submitted this photograph to many newspapers and ufo
            groups, but have only ever received one reply that said "very interesting" I
            hope that this photo may ‘interest you'</p>

         <p>THE REPENT MIINSTRY OF BERENCE PUBUCATION OF UFO SIGNTINGS SINCE 1997 MAS
            PROMPTED ME TO WRITE TO YOU WITH THE UFO SIGHTING, I EXPERIENCED DURING THE WAR YEARS
            OF
            1943/44. APART FROM CLOSE FAMLIY AND FRIENDS, I HANE NEVER OFFICIALLY
            REPORTED THIS INCIDENT THE FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS; IN 1943/44 I WAS 15-16 YEARS
            OLD LIVING WITH MY PARENTS IN BARKING ESSEX. I WORKED IN LONDON AND IN ORDER TO AND IN THE COMMUTER QUES FOR TRAIN TICKETS IN THE
            MORINNG, I USED TO PURCHASE MY WORKMANS TICKET THE EVEINNG BEFORE AT BARKING
            RAILWAY STATION, ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENINNG, WALKING FROM MY HOUSE IN
            SOMERSY ROAD INTO SALISURY ROAD TOWARDS BARKING BEATON I SAW IN THE SKY A LARGE
            SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT (WITH COLORED LIGHTS ALL AROUND IT’S SIDE) SPINNING AROUND AND
            HOVERING ABOVE BARKING
            STATION BEFORE SPEEDILY FLOATING AND SPINNING AWAY IN THE
            DIRECTION OF BARKING PARK AND THEN DAGEINAM, I WANT TO ASSUME IT TO BE
            AROUND 300/400 FT ABOVE THE GROUND LEVEL AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FROM
            IT FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING, THE SIZE WAS AROUND 7 FEET WIDE AND 2
            FEET DEEP. I HAVE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED THIS SIGHTING WITH BEING CONNECTED
            TO THE WAR BUT SEEING ALL THESE PCITURES OF UFO'S, THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE REPLICA OF
            WHAT
            I SAW IN 1943/44. I ENCLOSE THE ARTICLE FROM THE DAILY MAIL. THE
            ILLUSTRATION IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAW ALL THESE YEARS AGO. </p>
         <h2>2628_pg172</h2>
         <p> I am writing to tell you what I really saw. In October
            1992 me and my 2 friends were in a town called Witchurch []. We were parked up for about an
            hour got out of the Datsun cherry car walked around the
            corner 3 mins away no sound listening 4 sounds because we were up to no good. Whent
            back to
            the car it was gone me and my 2 mates who can conferm this true story I am telling.
            The car
            had gone the day in back seats gone and my tent, as we were all baffled by what was
            happening all of us in dis-belife. Where does the car go no sound just
            round corner 3 mins and gone vanished. Walking down a long road and
            all 3 saw [] I said look Boys what the fuck is that. In dis-[]. I said look
            pink flamingos flying south for summer, [] gigging me mate. Said
            their fire flies I gigged with my mate. My other mate said nothing. Their
            were about 12-15 flying objects in the sky they were in
            formation of a triangle. I hear no sounds we see
            then cross past us about 1 mins then we all walked home to [] diagram what I and.
