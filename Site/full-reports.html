                           <p>
                                I'm not a UFO person, doesn't really interest me in the slightest. I don't either believe that it 
                              could be possible. But I was upstairs in my room (I'm 17), and my mom called me down.
                              We 
                              were both amazed to see something in the sky. I live in Great Barr, Birmingham, UK. I know 
                              for a fact that we couldn't have been the only people to have saw the thing in the sky. It was 
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">insanely bright</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">so bright it hurt my eyes</span>, and so bright that it could be seen for 5 minutes after 
                              it has passed overhead. There was also an aeroplane in the sky at the same time, I'd
                              put 
                              money on them seeing it.
                              
                              It happened like 5 minutes ago, the only way i could describe it, is as being a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">really bright 
                                 jellyfish</span>. The sort you see in documentaries glowing in the deep seas. It probably looked 
                              nothing like a jellyfish; but that was the general shape. I know I keep repeating myself, but If I 
                              google what I saw I bet someone else saw it too. It seemed to descend over my house,
                              but 
                              that was just probably the fact that it was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">immensely big</span>. My mom is still gobsmacked.</p>
                           <p>I had to share this. If I didn't tell anyone I would have probably exploded.

                              P.S. If you know anything about it, please tell me!</p>

                           <p> Hi,</p>
                           <p>I'm not sure that these were UFOs, but last night on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">02/02/2009</span> I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">2 strange lights in the sky</span> over
                              Basingstoke in Hampshire. At
                              11:1Opm my partner and I noticed a very <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> bright orange light
                                 travelling very fast</span> from North to South East. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was too large and
                                 bright to be a plane</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was in view for approx 1 minute then
                                 disappeared behind a cloud</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">We could notice no noise or
                                 tail</span>. At 12:10am on 8 February I noticed what appeared to
                              be an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">extremely bright</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">white star</span>, where the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange light</span> had originated. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The star seemed to fall out of
                                 the sky, towards the ground very quickly</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It disappeared within
                                 seconds</span>. If you happen to know what these lights were and could let me know, I
                              would appreciate it.</p>
                           <p>Kind regards <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>Hello,</p>
                           <p> I trust that both of you are the correct personnel to help with my enquiry. If
                              not I would be grateful if you would forward this email to correct personnel.
                              
                              Please find below a UFO eye witness statement that I have submitted to the UK
                              UFO SIGHTING website. The first object detailed below was a helicopter,
                              however, I would like you to see if you can provide any explanation or identify
                              the second craft that was seen by myself on Saturday night <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">10/31/2009</span>.
                              I assure you that this is not a hoax.
                              
                              "Incidents occurred over Winchburgh, West Lothian between 7.30 to 8.30 pm
                              - two incidents are described, one was definately a helicopter but the other
                              craft could not be identified.
                              
                              The two events happened within an hour - at about 7.30pm heard rapid approach
                              of a helicopter - could have been Police chopper as I have seen this flying
                              over area but usually during daytime. It finally came into view (standing in my
                              back garden which faces west) and heard / saw obvious chopper but could not
                              distinguish make. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Engine sounded different to police chopper</span> although it was
                              flying much lower than normal. Saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">navigation lights</span> and curiously the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">whole
                                 underside of the helicopter cabin was illuminated in a white light</span> (was not the
                              searchlight - this was actual underside of craft that was illuminated). This
                              passed over and flew away flying generally from west to east. Came inside, had
                              dinner then after clearing up went outside again for some fresh air and glad I
                              did.
                              
                              An object, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">flying VERY low</span>, came into view about three houses along to my
                              right. I could not make out full body but using red lights it seemed to be
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">cylindrical and as wide as an ordinary helicopter</span>. This object came from south
                              east flying in general direction of north west toward Blackness / River Forth.
                              Three things I noted : (1) <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was totally silent</span>, (2) <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it had two large red
                                 navigation lights on body with one on top and other on bottom but placed      
                                 diagonally opposite each other</span> i.e. bottom left and top right from angle I was
                              viewing object, and (3) <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">was moving VERY slowly, infact, almost drifting</span>. Object
                              in full view (at an angle) for only about
                              8 seconds. Regretted not driving to chase object as i had went upstairs to rear
                              bedroom to see if i could gain a better view. By this time object had gone
                              behind trees on the small west facing embankment but could still see the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">flashing red strobe lights</span> - one strobe went then the other went off in a
                              repeated set design (i.e. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights did not operate randomly</span>). Object was then
                              lost from view. Would like to state that it could not have been a plane as it
                              would have stalled due to the very low speed (<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">estimated 5 to 10 mph</span>).
                              Helicopter possible but why no noise - not aware that choppers can be slienced
                              at such a low altitude, as object could only have been a couple of hundred feet
                              off the ground..... if that {note it came in very low, just above double storey
                              rooftop level). <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">There was no noise, no vibration and no electro-magnetic
                                 interference</span> as far as 1 could see (house lights stayed on, did not flicker etc).
                              
                              Noted on other recent reports that drones (presume man made unmanned 
                              aircraft) were reported in skies above Edinburgh area and this is a
                              possibility, but why fly them at such a low altitude and over populated areas?
                              There was no further sign of the chopper after this incident, but noted a
                              commercial aircraft on final approach to Edinburgh Airport coming in from
                              roughly the southwest may have had object in sight. Have emailed Edinburgh
                              Airport and <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">RAF Leuchars</span> to see if they can shed any light on this incident." </p>

                           <p>Last night at around 10.30pm my husband and I
                              watched in the sky <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">9 bright orange circular shapes glide across the night sky</span>. They seemed
                              to be travelling at a speed similar to that of an aircraft. At first I thought it was an
                              aeroplane with a different coloured light ( we live on a flight path for <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Manchester
                                 Airport</span>), but then one after the other more and more lights came into view. Then I thought
                              it was fireworks, but they don't last that long, and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">don't move like these lights did</span>. It
                              lasted for a couple of mins. I went outside and saw a neighbour who was out walking her dog,
                              and she was as stunned as I was. Have there been any more reports made? <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">08/01/2009</span>.

                           <p><span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">03/27/2009</span>at about 4:1Opm
                              in Walthamstow London, Driving home
                              from work I had a sighting. At first I fought I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three white
                                 birds circling in the sky</span>. I soon realised that these were not
                              birds as they were to <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">far away and large</span>. As they circled <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">they
                                 were dipping in and out of the clouds</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">These objects were to fast to
                                 be aeroplanes and continued circling</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">they could have been a light
                                 sources or they could have been reflecting light</span>. Cannot remember exact
                              shape as all happened to quickly. Possible <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> small tail of light
                                 underneath each one at a slight angle away from the direction of the objects
                                 travel</span>. My sighting was breath as I turned a corner and drove through a built
                              up area hoping to catch a glimpse later on my journey but this was not to be. I
                              should have stopped the car to get a better look. Any idea what I might have
                              seen? Have you received any other reports that might tie in with this sighting in

                                 than one there</span>, usually a pair of them <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">appearing one after another in
                                 a distance and difference of heights</span> b/w 'em. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">hanging in one point
                                 still for minutes, then disappearing momentarily</span>. One time <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a
                                 'triangle' formation of near a dozen of those appeared</span> as well, with one of
                              them hanging aside off the triangle ('the admiral ship'). Unfortunately,
                              I was busy looking for fresh batteries for my camera and this was the only sample
                              capture I was able to take until the camera died. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The object was
                                 perfectly still</span>, all the movements while zoomed-in are due to my hands'

                           <p>Dear Sir/ Madam,</p>
                           <p>Please forgive me if I have your information wrong. I have been given advice from
                              a
                              colleague of mine to contact yourself. This was not reported to Police per say but
                              I thought
                              I ought to let you know as I saw it. I have been a serving Police Officer for a
                              number of years now and my Partner Karl Norman who was with me at the time is an
                              ex serviceman in the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">RAF</span>. I was at my friends address
                              in Brightlingsea, Essex on New
                              Years Eve seeing in the New Year, just before midnight myself and my
                              partner were in the back garden having a cigarette; I could hear fireworks in the
                              distance so looked up to see it I could see them. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">In the sky was a
                                 bright orange/yellow light</span> at first glance I Ignored it thinking it was
                              a trailing firework but then double took as it did not disappear. My immediate
                              thought was we are near water and perhaps that could explain the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">light</span>
                              but it still did not disappear, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it moved very slowly in like a half circle around
                                 the top of us</span> then <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">stopped over the water</span> between Brightingsea and East Mersea. It was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">quite
                                 large</span> and the night was extremely clear with no clouds or
                              mist. I would hazard a guess about <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">1500 to 2000 feet up</span>.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It stayed perfectly still for about 3-4 minutes then appeared to shoot straight
                                 up in the air very fast, going completely out of view in less then 30 seconds</span>,
                              I must be honest I stood there a bit in awe and missed the start of the new year
                              because of it. In fact I even called my friends daughter to see it! It may be
                              completely trivial to you and you may even press the delete button, but after a few
                              days of
                              wondering whether I was seeing things I saw the news about the Lincoln sightings and
                              damage
                              to the wind turbine I could have fallen off my seat it was very similar to what I
                              saw New
                              years eve. With Karl being ex <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">RAF</span> I asked him quite
                              innocently what it was and he was as disturbed as I was with no answer! I would not
                              have
                              bothered you with it in all honesty but having it play on my mind a few days I thought
                              you
                              were the best people to make the decision about whether it was worth your time or
                              not. If
                              you have any questions or queries I will be happy to assist in any way possible. My

                           <p>Hi</p>
                           <p> I would like to report a UFO sighting. I organised a BBQ for some
                              friends on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">07/11/2009</span> at my
                              parents home in palmers green, North
                              London (n13). We live in a small row of terraced houses just off the
                              A406, on a busy dual carriageway. The weather was pretty drizzly that
                              evening but as i had planned it for some time. decided to go ahead.
                              At the time of the sighting (think it was between 8-9 pm) i was in the
                              garden with 2 friends when i saw an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange fireball about to crash</span> 2
                              gardens away (about 50m away). My initial thought was it was a plane on fire about to
                              crash. but it wasn't travelling fast enough as a crashing plane, more
                              like a slow motion crash as we had time to comment on the trajectory. We
                              all waited for the 'bang' but nothing. One of my friends ran upstairs to see if
                              she could see it from the bathroom... She called as it was now <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">very high in the sky
                                 about 1/2 a mile away</span>. We all went back into the garden and discussed what it
                              was. we soon realised it was not any of the following • airplane/ helicopter - no
                              noise •
                              Mare / firework - <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no smoke</span> and it also <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">moved from a 30 degree
                                 gradient about to crash, to moving very high in the sky</span>. • air balloon- as it
                              was very close, we could see it was a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">pure ball of fire</span>, also again the
                              movement. Upon being in the garden, again another object passed by about 3-5 minutes
                              after seeing the first one. This time it did not follow the 30 degree 'crashing'
                              trajectory but flew past a little higher but along the same path, 2 gardens
                              away. This time we all ran upstairs to the bathroom to get a better- further look
                              at where
                              it was going. Again it went up very high about half mile away. I ran to get my digital
                              SLR
                              camera with telescopic lense, but the camera refused to take a picture... just zooming
                              in
                              and out. again we returned to the garden, discussing what we had seen. For the third
                              time another object flew overhead, we dashed upstairs again, again grabbing my
                              camera, again unable to take a picture, so instead i grabbed my small digital camera.
                              I managed to capture an image of this one but not as close as i would have
                              liked. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">This object seemed to have something protruding from the main
                                 body</span>. Almost like <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was a spherical object on fire, but with a leg
                                 protruding from it, also on fire, but with a visible gap between the body and the
                                 leg.</span> yet they moved together in unison as fi they were attached. In
                              short • we saw 3 spherical fireballs, with an orange glow • seen north London N13
                              •
                              approx 8 9- pm saturday 11th July 2009. • 3 witnesses - no alcohol involved • all
                              following same path. one almost appearing to crash before appearing higher in the
                              sky •
                              distance of 25 - 50 metres.</p>
                           <p>Hope this is of some help, i would like to hear some feedback if possible. regards
                              <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>Dear Sir</p>
                           <p> I have just seen six UFOS whilst driving home. I am sure there is a good explanation
                              and
                              would like to check if you had military craft on exercise in the area to this number.
                              At
                              12:31 this evening, approx half an hour ago I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">6 lights almost in an S
                                 shape</span>
                              slowly moving across the sky. I was on the road FROM Humberston (suburb of Cleethorpes) to Tetnoy, North East
                              Lines. I was on the straight just before Tetnoy villaqe when I saw through my cars
                              front
                              window these 6 lights. I’ve never seen anything like them, it just looked very odd.
                              I pulled
                              over and got out to look further. They were moving in formation from West to north
                              east {towards the sea). The conditions were misty in the sky,
                              although at ground level it was clear. Then one of the lights
                              disappeared quickly. I got back into the car to follow the lights and pulled
                              over again further along. Only two lights remained and gradually faded out. I would
                              like to
                              note that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">there was NO sound</span>. I would like this to be anonymous, you are
                              welcome to contact me discreetly but I do not want the media to know of me or my name
                              as I
                              run several businesses and have a reputation to oonsider. I have taken several photographs
                              on my phone but can not examine them or blow them up until I get back into office
                              as I have
                              left cable there. I would appreciate knowing if you had six helicopters in the area
                              at this
                              time or have I seen a genuine UFO formation? </p>

                           <p></p>
                           <p>During the early hours of 15 February 2009 at around
                              00:15hrs i was with my wife and two friends driving through
                              Winwick Warrington. I was
                              driving and sighted <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">two orange lights in the sky</span> which was
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">hovering over the old hospital</span> sight that is now a housing
                              development. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The lights were not together but were stationary</span>. We stopped
                              the car and got out to have a look. As we did we saw other people in nearby houses also
                              stood looking at them. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">There was no noise from them at all</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">One
                                 then began moving and moved away out of sight</span> in a southern direction.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The second light stayed in placed and then after around 30 seconds also moved
                                 away</span> in the same direction. Again <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">there was no noise</span>.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was out of sight within around 15 seconds</span>. There was definitely
                              something strange about it I am not a real believer in ufos but there is no other
                              explanation. </p>

                           <p>I would like to explain what I saw on the night of Saturday 9th May 2009 over <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span>
                              ariow Essex<span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> A <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">diamond
                                 shaped orange light</span> was above me which was also witnessed by my 7 year old
                              son. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It certainly was not a plane</span> as these could be <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">seen clearly
                                 at a greater height and all flashing lights</span> could be seen on those.
                              Above us (if you were to hold out your hand) it would have been the size of a 20
                              pence piece. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The object was almost silent</span> as this was
                              around 10pm, and carried on its path into the distance. I went to
                              call my partner and at the same time was talking to my son about what we had both
                              seen and
                              in the same place another orange object appeared and travelled in the same direction,
                              again,
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no flashing lights or obvious shape and also almost silent</span>. I
                              waited for almost 20 minutes trying to convince myself it may have been the route
                              of
                              planes, but nothing else was seen. I managed to take a picture of the
                              iphone which I have attached for you to view. The pictures are a little small,
                              but I hope they can be of some help.</p>
                           <p>Any feedback would be great if its possible. Thanks in advance <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
                           <p>I live by Waterloo, London, on a 10th floor
                              flat overlooking a substantial part of the southern part of the city. I have become quite
                              perturbed over the past couple of nights by UFO's, of which I believe that I have seen
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">3 of varying sizes</span>. My profession is of that of a CEO of two
                              companies listed on the stockmarket, so i think myself to be a sensible and sane individual.
                              The sightings involve <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">one object with a white light and alternating red lights at
                                 an angle</span>. The object came from south-east London, headed toward
                              Canary Wharf,<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> stopped in mid air</span>, at which
                              point <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">an alternating sequence of red lights flashed at a 180 degree angle</span>
                              with <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the top light being on the left hand side of the object</span> with the
                              lights moving down toward the bottom right of the angle, before the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights switched
                                 side instantaneously and the object went back toward south-east</span> London.
                              Roughly <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">one minute later the object returned in my direction</span>,
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the red lights continuing to lash alongside it</span>, before it headed
                              north over my apartment and out of sight. My most recent sighting took place at
                              22:52 tonight, 23 February 2009. This sighting occurred for four
                              seconds, and was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the flashing of a huge object taking up a portion of the sky the
                                 size</span> of which I have never seen before. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It appeared to be flying
                                 low</span>, and had, as I recall, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three lights</span>, of which one I
                              believe was a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">normal white light, and the other two were green lights</span>.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It vanished out of my sight almost immediately</span>, and I was unable to
                              track the lights. If you are able to shed light on either of these two incidents I
                              would be
                              most grateful. I do not proclaim to be an expert in helicopters, but am able to spot one
                              from my window with ease normally.</p>
                           <p> Many thanks. Yours Faithfully, <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p><span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> Just to confirm as requested our conversation of this afternoon. <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> of Wroughton
                              (Tel
                              No: <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> ) telephoned the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">RAF</span> Lyneham ATC Supervisor on
                              Monday, 15 Jun 09 to ask whether we had had any <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">unusual aircraft</span> in the
                              vicinity of Wroughton
                              between 1930 and 200hrs (local) the previous evening (14 Jun 09). I told
                              him that nothing had been seen by the Lyneham controllers and we had had no reports
                              of
                              anything unusual. He told me that he had seen <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">black, disc-shaped objects</span>,
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">50ft in diameter</span> with <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights shining from beneath</span>
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">them hovering over crop circles</span> near Barbury Castle (near Wroughton, just
                              south of Junction 15 of the M4). T<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">he discs cast shadows beneath them</span> and
                              were captured on two separate video cameras. He asked me to let him know
                              if we discovered anything about the objects.</p>
                           <p>I hope that this is of interest to you. Regards <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>In Winsford Cheshire at
                              approx 23:00 hrs we noticed <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">an orange light which travelled
                                 over our house</span> from the south. This was not the normal flight
                              path we see for aircraft going into Manchester airport. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was then
                                 followed by 2 more orange lights on the same path</span>. This made me go outside to
                              see yet there was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no noise for a craft which was only at an altitude of a helicopter</span>. A few
                              seconds later 5 more objects appeared then another 2. I took pictures of the objects passing
                              over but <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">there was no noise and they then eventually gained height and all disappeared</span>
                              north. Do you have any details of activity in our area which would explain this
                              sighting.</p>

                           <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
                           <p>On the <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">11/01/2009</span> at approximately 7:40 pm We were driving back from the
                              Matlock area in Derbyshire. It was an extremely clear night, I had strong intuition that I
                              should keep my camera with me, I sadly ignored that intuition and stuffed it into the boot.
                              A decision that I would later regret heartily. We had driven for about 15 minutes
                              when I
                              became aware of a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">very bright light in the sky</span>. Planes fly overhead all the time and I guess
                              this night was no different than any other, except to say that the plane I saw seemed odd,
                              it moved too slowly, considering how low in the sky it was. Moreover it was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">extremely low in
                                 the sky, helecopter low</span>. It was pitch black outside the car so I could not get a good look
                              at the plane. what I can tell you though is that it's altitude stuck me as odd, as
                              did its
                              lights. it seemd to have o<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">ne light in the middle and two constant lights on both flanks</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It
                                 had a small blinking light underneath</span>. As it flew low over Carsington water, I'd say it
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">wouldn't have been more than 300 feet up</span> at the very most. My real estimate would have been
                              100 feet. Now i'm not saying that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">this was an Alien spacecraft</span>. Yet to me <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was a UFO</span>. UFO
                              doesn't mean alien spacecraft that would be an ETV (Extra Terrestrial Vehicle). It was a UFO
                              because ti wasn't like any plane I have ever seen, it wasn't on a Flight path I have
                              ever
                              seen. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It moved Slower than any commercial plane</span> I have ever seen. What was it? I watched it
                              fly over Carsington lake and then I lost sight of it for a few seconds, ti was gone.
                              Yet, I
                              had a perfect view over the lake, as we climbed towards Kniveton near Ashbourne. Where
                              did
                              this low flying object go? I certainly felt unnerved. Rightly so. This part of Derbyshire,
                              Matlock, Wirksworth, Bonsall is well known for its UFO reports, even more so lately.
                              This
                              year, 2009 has seen the highest incidence of UFO reports Worldwide since records began. My
                              partner who was driving the car, doesn't really hold with UFO's. I think she'd have
                              to see
                              one to believe it. She tends to express the view that there is a rational explanation
                              for
                              this sort of sighting and that there is no point making a fuss. This is the view help
                              by the
                              majoroty of the population. If fact I believe it too, except that I have long had
                              an
                              interest in UFO's because of very unusual things I have seen for years now. On with
                              the
                              story. We drove on, I had now got a sneaking suspicion that we would see something
                              else
                              unusual. There seemed to be a lot of activity in the skies, but nothing quite as startling
                              as what I had just seen. When we got to Uttoxeter, we were approaching the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Mcdonalds</span>
                              roundabout when I became aware of a very large red light low in the sky. The red light
                              seemed to be near to the Racecourse, it was at least 2 miles away though, so impossible
                              to
                              tell what it was, my partner also saw this. She looked a little spooked. I asked her
                              to turn
                              off toward the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">light</span> but she declined and drove on towards Stoke on Trent. I couldn't help
                              but feel that we had missed an opportunity to investigate. That said, having the family
                              in
                              the car probably wasn't the best UFO hunting opportunity. We drove on. Then things
                              got
                              really good. As we approached Stoke on Trent down the A50. We were at the Britannia
                              stadium
                              when I looked across to my right (uk drivers side) and saw a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">very bright white light</span> right
                              over stoke town. I asked my partner what the hell it was, again she looked spooked
                              and,
                              again turned away from it opting to drive down to Newcastle via the Handford roundabout,
                              much to my frustration, I wanted to try to get a photograph of this light. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was so bright</span>.
                              As we left the Handford Roundabout the light became visible again. I pointedly asked
                              her to
                              look at it. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was a white light with tow smaller while lights on either side of it</span>. As
                              though on stalks or like spotlights. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">We could hear no Helecopter noise</span>, even though my
                              partner assured me that was what it was. As we drove along the A34 we were both looking
                              at
                              this light. It was definitely <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no more than 100 feet off the ground</span>. Suddenly, and this is
                              the best bit <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it changed colour from white to emerald green</span>. Again, I alerted my partner to
                              this, I said "look at it, tell me it has changed colour and I'm not imagining it".
                              She
                              confirmed that it had changed colour, the two small white sidelights seemed to have
                              disappeared. At this point we were directly by the Tesco's at Trent Vale, and I could
                              still
                              see the object, I tried to get a photo. I took 2 and one caught a tiny bit of green
                              glow.
                              the image was very disappointing. Like so many UFO experiences I had failed to get
                              any
                              decent evidence and that truly is frustrating. Simply because 99% of all ufo photos are so
                              inconclusive that nothing can be proved. Yet again my photos was certainly no different. If
                              only I had kept the SLR in the front with me. Mobile phone pic below taken from inside
                              moving car. see left side green glow. sorry thats all i got. Rubbish I know. We arrived
                              home
                              minutes late and I scanned around and then went out for a drive to see if I could
                              see
                              anything unusual, I couldn't. What we did see that night though was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">3 objects that were
                                 unusual</span>. For once I had another witness who saw at least 2 of these objects. I felt sure
                              that this incident was so unusual I simply had to check it out. I called the Police
                              that
                              night to ask if the helecopter was up and flying in that region. they said they'd
                              check and
                              get back to me. No one got back. So I called again on Monday morning. I spoke with
                              <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Staffordshire Police</span> and asked them to check. They, recorded the incident (Trent Vale) and
                              ran checks to see if the helecopter was flying. They called back to say that they
                              had no
                              record of the Police helecopter flying that night. this still doesn't mean it was
                              an ETV,
                              but it rules out police helcopters. Other options could be military helecopters or
                              the Air
                              Ambulance. I called the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Civil Aviation authority</span> who told me that small aircraft do not have
                              to register their flight plan with them. So I have thus drawn a blank. Whatever I
                              saw looked
                              weird to me. I'm keen to rule out check all conventional options. Yet I'd just like
                              to say
                              that what I saw in all three locations that night is consistent with current UFO sightings
                              across the country and the world. i enclose a poorly executed summary image of the craft I
                              saw.</p>

                              heading through direction of Silloth Cumbria. Witness location was field to SE ( 200
                              yards
                              from house) - interviewer taken to exact site and details pointed out. Conclusion
                              of witness
                              (aged 25) and interviewer (father): <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">solid craft under control bearing no similarity
                                 to any known terrestrial aircraft</span> and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">exhibiting an ability to
                                 maintain a constant height above the ground at a speed which would not allow any normal
                                 propulsion system or aerodynamic structure to maintain lift</span>, other than such
                              as VSTOL type aircraft and balloons (both definitely ruled out).
                              Definitely not astronomical or meteorological phenomenon. [Sketch of

                           <p> I attach photographs of a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">flying object</span> I encountered over Filey town centre at 00:46
                              yesterday (<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">09/02/2009</span>.) I was completely transfixed by it and watched it for a few
                              minutes before I panicked and hurried back to my parents flat. The best way I can describe
                              its appearance is <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a brilliant and dazzling pure white horizontal ring of light</span>. It appeared
                              to be <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">perfectly still in the sky above the houses and was totally silent</span>. I took these
                              pictures from the corner of Chapel Street and Station Avenue and I would estimate
                              that it
                              was hovering above the Belle Vue Crescent area. I noticed that <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">RAF</span> jets were doing fly over
                              the town the following morning.... surely this is not a coincidence? All I can say is that
                              it was the strangest experience of my life and thought I should report it to someone.</p>

                           <p> Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
                           <p> Whilst driving along Wolstanton Road, Chesterton, Newcastle Under Lyme at
                              18:32 on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">04/02/2009</span> I
                              noticed an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange light fairly low in the sky</span>. At first I thought it was
                              a street light but then realised that it was too high in the sky. It was a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">dullish
                                 orange colour</span> and what made me think it strange was that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was
                                 approximately 15-20 times larger than a normal star but at the same time not as
                                 bright</span>. I also knew it was not Venus as that is visible in another part
                              of the sky. The<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> object was circular in shape but did not have a defined
                                 edge</span> and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">its surface appeared to have movement or texture much like a
                                 small section of the suns surface but infinately dimmer</span>. I pulled over
                              in my car and pointed the object out to my two children <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> and <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span>. <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> asked me
                              what it was to which I could only tell her that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it might be a fireball</span> as
                              I had heard of these in the press and <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> asked 'what's the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange round thing in
                                 the sky</span>'. I grabbed my mobile phone and tried to take a photo of the
                              object but it did not appear on the photo. I then switched my phone to
                              video camera mode and filmed the object for approx fourty seconds. As I was
                              filming, the object looked as though it was beginning to <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">back away from us whilst
                                 getting slightly higher in the sky and at this same time it was also reducing in
                                 size</span> . <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">When the object reached about half the size it was when we
                                 originally spotted it an aircraft appeared from my right hand side</span> and
                              appeared to be heading in the direction of the object whilst giving it a wide berth.
                              A few
                              seconds later <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the object reduced to a pin point of light and then completely
                                 disappeared from view</span>. On arrival back home I took out my mobile phone
                              and the film I had taken of the object was gone but the photo I had taken remained
                              intact. On viewing the photo the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">ball of light</span> can be clearly
                              seen. There are a number of stars in the photo so establishing wether this object
                              should
                              have been there or not should be easily calculable as there are several points of
                              reference
                              within the photo and the exact time and date is known. Unfortunately I am having problems
                              attaching the photo to this mail at this time.</p>
                           <p>Many thanks <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>Hi,</p>
                           <p>I'm sure you must get so many reports of UFOs, but I thought you might be interested
                              in my
                              experience tonight I can't quite believe what I saw tonight, but it made me rush out
                              onto
                              the street camera in hand. I was very sober when I saw what I am about to describe.
                              Until
                              recently I was a journalist and we used to get similar stories like this from time
                              to time
                              which we would all have a good laugh at (not any more!) I was sitting on the couch
                              when I
                              saw an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange light in the sky</span>. My initial thoughts were 'that
                              plane is flying low· and I went back to watching TV. However, five/ten minutes
                              or so later I couldn't believe it when I saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">several orange lights</span> -
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">about the same colour and brightness of street lights</span> -
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">about half a dozen in total</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Three of them were closer
                                 together than the others and were in a straight, but horizontal line.</span>
                              I shouted upstairs to my boyfriend, who also witnessed the incident. I then
                              told him I was getting the camera before running outside -with no shoes on (the neighbours
                              must think I'm mad). Unfortunately my camera is not great, but I have attached the
                              pictures
                              anyway in the hope you can enhance them. On the one marked UFO 001 you can see <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a
                                 round shape</span>, which was not visible to the naked eye and only appeared when I
                              blew up the photo. I believe it may show the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three lights in a horizontal
                                 line</span> I described earlier. The whole incident could have only happened
                              over a couple of minutes, maybe less. The lights seemed to fade away, except one
                              which I saw go behind some houses and I followed it a short way down the street on
                              foot
                              before it also disappeared. The incident happened around 9:20pm today
                              (<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">04/11/2009</span>). I live in a village
                              called which is in Chesterfield,
                              Derbyshire. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else saw what I
                              have described and if any explanation can be given.</p>
                           <p>Thank you</p>

                                 6 bright orange lights in the sky flying</span> <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">1 minute behind them there were two more</span> and
                              another <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">few minutes later a solitary orange light</span>, the last <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">one looked much bigger and
                                 brighter</span>. They werent fireworks, and im not drunk, I videoed the lone one but its poor
                              quality. This was above Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire, UK, flying in the direction of
                              dewsbury. About 2300 hours tonight 6/11/09, It probably was aircraft but I saw no other
                              coloured lights on wings. please reply. Im baffledl!!! </p>

                           <p>I have attached a photo that was taken summer last year. There is a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">dark
                                 shape</span> just to the right side of the telephone pole, i
                              first noticed it above the hill to left it moved to the right going out of view behind
                              the house, reapearing then seemed to fade out…In the second photo I zoomed in i
                              was using a standard digital camera. Its probalby nothing but just <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">seemed a little

                           <p>Hi.</p>
                           <p>Over the past two weeks the same event has been witnessed by myself and my girlfriend
                              twice, and a third person on a completely independant occasion. Last night (<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">07/15/2009</span>) at around about 23.30, I
                              myself any my girlfriend noticed what seemed to be a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">very bright white
                                 light</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">almost like a large Star</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">appearing to move
                                 slowly in the sky</span>, north- West of
                              Trimkey St Mary. Suffolk. above the river Orwell. The <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Light</span> to moved
                              south, doubled back on itself in a smooth motion to its original position in sky, at which
                              point <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a similar light suddenly appeared with it</span>. T<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">he two lights almost "danced" around each
                                 other, each making our one equal hall of a circle. before splitting of in completely
                                 opposite directions</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The original light quickly veered towards our position, whilst the
                                 newer light moved off at speed towards the north west, away from us</span>. At this point it became
                              apparent that <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the lights were either moving at speed or were much lower in the air that
                                 first apparent</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The Light cruised above us</span>. and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">I noticed that unlike most aircraft there
                                 was only this single bright white light. no repeating flashes, or different coloured
                                 lights
                                 usually seen</span>. (There were at least 3other conventional aircraft in the sky at the time with
                              which to compare the object) A vauge black outline could be made out surrounding the light
                              against the night sky. however this may have just been wishful thinking from my eyes, trying
                              to imagine the shape. As I commented, there were other aircraft in the sky, and a
                              vauge
                              drone could he heard from the one closest to us. however <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the "Light" made absolutely no
                                 noise what so ever.</span> Also in comparisons with the other aircraft. this Light was clearly
                              closer to us that expected. As the Light reached almost mediately overhead. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it disappeared
                                 instantaneously</span>. At that point in time. there was very little cloud cover and the Stars
                              could be seen clearly, so I ruled out the disruption if cloud cover. The previously <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright
                                 white light</span>, simply disappeared before us. Usually I would have put something such as this
                              down to perhaps just a normal aircraft, a Chinese lantern or just an odd experience.
                              However, as I mentioned, this is the second time in two weeks both myself and my girlfriend
                              have witnessed the exact same sequence of events, over the same time scale. Last time
                              I had
                              just brushed the sighting off as "odd" We arrived at my girlfriends house, and began
                              to tell
                              her mum of what we've just seen. At which point she interrupted, stating that she
                              had seen
                              the exact same thing, with incredibly similar movements the previous week. Describing
                              the
                              "dance" as if she had seen through my own eyes. She was unaware of what we had seen,
                              and
                              visa versa. The only objects that I can think resembles the light most simply, by
                              way of an
                              explanation, are Chinese lanterns. But this wouldn't explain the "dance", or the fact
                              the
                              two moved off in opposite directions. (Particularly the one above us, moving against
                              the
                              wind). <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The lights were just far too bright to be a lantern</span> my opinion. and acted and looked
                              so unlike conventional aircraft that I cannot think of an explanation. </p>

                           <p><span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">I suspect they were meteors</span> (do not believe in ET!), however, my
                              Husband, two young children and I all clearly witnessed some <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">very strange lights in
                                 the sky</span> over Farleigh/Warlingham, Surrey last night, (<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">03/01/2008</span>) at approximately 7pm.
                              We were driving home from Selsdon, Surrey, and heading up Farleigh Road towards Warlingham
                              when we spotted <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three very bright orange lights</span> in the sky. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They
                                 appeared circular, with no tail</span> that was visible, and were travelling at speed
                              towards the East (approx). <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They were visible for a good 4-5 minutes very
                                 brightly</span>, at which pointed they slowly faded and disappeard one by one. I saw
                              one on it's own first off, which appeared to be just above the tree line ahead, and thought
                              it looked like an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange street lamp</span>, but realised that as we rounded the
                              corner there were two others - <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">they were all high in the sky and together they
                                 appeard to be in a triangular formation to start</span>. We pulled over in the
                              entrance to Farleigh Golf Club and watched as they flew over our head before dissapearing.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They made no noise</span>, and we could not tell how high they were. Someone
                              pulled over behind us, pressumably to watch too, however, we did not speak to them.
                              Would
                              love to know if these <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights</span> have been reported by anyone else and if
                              anyone would know what it was we saw. Why do we never have a camera when we really
                              need one! </p>
                           <p>A response would be much appreciated. Many thanks <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>HI,</p>
                           <p> I’m an eve witness who lives near Lyneham
                              Air base in Calne, This <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">09/20/2008</span> myself and many others witnessed UFO activity around
                              10pm In the Calne area. We witnessed <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">5 super bright glowing
                                 orange/pink orbs at low altitude flying above us that had unusual flying characteristic
                                 and were totally silent in flight</span>! <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">They were (NOT) flares</span>
                              from Salisbury as could elevate as well as descend Did Air traffic control pick these
                              UFOs
                              up on radar or know what craft they were? I’m convinced these vessels were not military
                              as
                              civilians know of and <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">looked of exterrestrial form</span> even though I’m aware
                              of technology that is hidden from public knowledge! These <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright orbs</span>
                              went out of vision as we re-located in an attempt to get a closer viewing and thought
                              we had
                              lost the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">vessels</span> for good! However less than a minute later we
                              followed a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">solo flying fireball</span> above us that gradually made its way
                              In the direction of Wootton Bassett climbing altitude until could no longer be
                              seen Again I think this was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a craft of some sort and not a comet or weather
                                 balloon</span> as x1 it was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">climbing altitude and travelled to quickly to be
                                 a balloon</span> and eventually entered space Again did Air control track this
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">huge fireball</span> that made a right tum above us towards Wootton Bassett? I and others know of Black project

                           <p>request: Me and a friend were heading up the A19 north bound, going just past
                              borrowby between mt grace (10:40PM), I noticed some <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright green lights with a blue light</span> moving
                              very quickly through the trees and once we came past the trees the craft cut across
                              the motoway in what can only be described as a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">very unusual large and silent craft</span>
                              moving very fast wich then changed direction and headed towards the back of the car
                              and shot out of site very quickly. I have seen low flying fighter jets before and i
                              know they have quite a loud distinct noise and shape when flying. The craft that we
                              saw was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">silent, moving extremely fast, very large and had multiple bright lights</span> on it
                              not to mention its unusual shape.</p>
                           <p>Please if you can shed some light on the matter and
                              did have low flying air crafts in this area iet me know as i thought we were both
                              going mad.</p>

                              Hi, i would like to report a sighting of a flying saucer i've seen.  
                              On the <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">08/15/2008</span> at 9:10pm while riding home on my motorcycle, i spotted <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">three bright orange
                                 lights</span> in the sky about a mile away, i pulled over to look and noticed that the lights were
                              heading towards me. The lights switched off one by one but i could still see one of the objects, i
                              lost sight of the other two, this object was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">black and disc shaped, it also moved quick and was
                                 silent.</span>
                              
                              My location - Argoed South Wales. 
                              The lights were first spotted south of me near Blackwood and one saucer was observed heading
                              north.
                              The saucer was in clear view over head at one point.
                              I've also been told that there was a sighting about the same in Bargoed.</p>
                           <p>I'm not the best at typing so i've kept it short but if theres any details you think
                              i've missed out
                              or any question, just ask. Thanks <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>Dear <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>
                           <p>My name is <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> I am 19 and in Kendal. I have seen these <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange
                                 lights</span> in the sky on two occassions (see below) since Friday, and I can say
                              with absolute certainty that these are <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">not sateliltes, space debris or the
                                 ISS.</span>
                              
                              The first sighting was looking west ofKendal at around 11pm on Friday
                              night. Quite low was a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright red/orange light</span> which I assumed was a
                              light of a communications antenna but then realised there aren't any in
                              that area so I stopped and watched it. I then thought It must be a red
                              flare, but a few seconds later a bright, phosphorus white light fell from
                              the orange one, and drifted siowly towards the ground before
                              disappearing. As soon as the white light disappeared the red one slowly
                              faded out. The red light was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">completly static</span> throughout the 10-15 second
                              sighting.
                              
                              This sighting was not enough to make me want fo email the Gazette, as I
                              thought there must be a logical explanation for it. However last night my
                              girlfriend came running into the house, in Kendal, and told me and my
                              brother to come outside (at around 11.15pm). She said she had just seen
                              an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">orange star</span> move from it’s place in the sky, dart across in a straight
                              line and then do a NINETY DEGREES TURN before stopping. How many
                              satellites can do this? We stared at it, and realised there were 3 other dim
                              orange lights, and they were constantly moving in a formation, as if they
                              were trying to find the correct position. They came very close together,
                              then very far apart, the one on the left went from the top of the triangle
                              (the shape they had formed) to the bottom within 2 or 3 seconds. The
                              lights finally settled in an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">arrow shape</span>, ie:
                              
                              
                              We watched for half an hour, but they weren't moving very much after
                              that, but we noticed a new dimmer light above and to the right of the left
                              light.
                              
                              
                              This new dimmer one moved alot, and the bottom right one started
                              moving more too. 
                              
                              Our necks were hurting and we'd been staring for half an hour so we
                              went outside, as they didn’t seem to be moving any more. I went back
                              out 5 minutes later to check up and they'd formed like this
                              
                              
                              This is not an exaggeration, and I wouldn't have e-mailed if I didn't see
                              this for such a long period last night. I hope with all the reports you are
                              getting you can let me know if anyone else saw either of the sightings, so
                              I don't think I'm going insane! The fact that my girlfriend saw a light do a
                              right-angle turn proves <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> can't dismiss these sightings as space
                              shuttles or satellites. </p>

                           <p> The Sun has reported a UFO sighting over Temhill Barracks in Shropshire at about 11pm on 7 June
                              2008. It appears that a number of soldiers saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights in the sky</span> and made a
                              video which they have passed to the newspaper. They have not made a formal written
                              report on
                              the matter, although they did inform their superiors. The <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">MoD</span> in London became involved when the
                              press office was contacted by the newspaper on 24th June. On 25th June I requested
                              a copy of
                              the video from <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Media Ops at HQ 5 Div</span> where it had been passed by the unit concerned. It
                              shows a number of lights in the sky. As reported in the paper, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the lights change
                                 colour and appear square, but this looks like the pixels snag up as the photographer
                                 zoomed in. They do not appear to be moving vary quickly</span>. The <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">BBC</span> has reported
                              that at the same time as the alleged incident, a local hotel was lighting off Chinese
                              lanterns and, apparently, the hotel manager thinks the whole UFO story is “highly
                              hilarious”. I do not intend to investigate any further as I think we have our answer and, as
                              I suspect there might be copyright issues surrounding the video, do not intend to
                              retain a
                              copy on our files. I will inform the soldiers of my decision through their 2ic. </p>

                           <p> With regards to the the Airprox incident report 055/08 which involved a <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">West Midlands Police</span> helicopter and an unidentified flying
                              object on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">05/02/2008</span> which shows a very extensive
                              investigation which took place. We are investigating this incident further as we have
                              2 additional Police Officers who experienced an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">object of a
                                 similar nature which had blue lights</span> on the previous night
                              1st May. We also have acquired photographs from an officer which we are trying to
                              confirm is of that particular night. Firstly this incident happened on the 2nd
                              May and involved an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">object with blue/green lights</span> and was witnessed by a
                              Police helicopter. We are looking for further assistance and a Freedom of Information
                              request on any details relating to this particular event. We are also seeking permission
                              to
                              use details from the Airprox report to further assist us and build part of our final
                              report.

                           <p>Enquiry:</p>
                           <p>I hope that you can help as this isn't a complaint. Like many others my husband and
                              I saw
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">strange objects flying</span> in the south side of
                              glasgow. We were driving on Cathcart Road in Glasgow (think G44 postcode) heading towards the city
                              centre. To our left were what we counted as <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">6 objects, in what to the eye was a
                                 static formation</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Two lines of 3 sitting side by side, one line a
                                 little higher than the other</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">One oject above the other</span>.
                              We turned off the main road to park the car and take photographs.
                              They were now in front of us and we were facing west. We have never in our lives
                              seen objects in the sky like this. Luckily we pulled over where other
                              members of the public had pulled over, along with dog walkers who had congregated
                              in
                              amazement. without managing to take a photo the objects seemed to start moving
                              further away, drawing themselves together to make themselves look like one object
                              and
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it/they it disappeared into the distance</span> heading towards the west.
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">At first quick glance they looked like they could have been helicopters but
                                 they definately weren't</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The light that they emitted was very strong
                                 and surrounded each object in full</span>. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">It was a yellow/orange</span>.
                              The whole sight was so extrodinary that after talking about it for hours we began
                              to doubt
                              ourselves. This is why we're so very glad to have met with other members of the
                              public so that our doubts couldn't be varified. We began to reason that the
                              evert would be in the local news as some sort of Christmas hoax but unfortunatelv
                              we've not
                              heard of anything apart from sightings on the 30th December about 20
                              minutes away by car! We would be most very thankful if you could inform us as to what
                              these
                              could have</p>

                           <p> We spoke, but the following is the basic story: I took a call this morning from the
                              2IC
                              rear part at 1 Royal Irish at Tern Hill
                              Capt<span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> on <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> A soldier who was part of a fire picket stagging on at the camp on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">06/07/2008</span> took video footage with a camera on a mobile phone
                              of what he says were "UFOs" in the sky above the camp - which they have
                              emailed to The Sun - and which The Sun is apparently planning on splashing - probably
                              tomorrow. I don't have all the details/timings but what I do have is the following:
                              1.
                              Soldier is Cpl <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> who the phone belongs to- he was accompanied by Pte <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> who also
                              witnessed
                              the "UFOs". 2. The footage was taken on 7 June at 23.03
                                          hrs, - with a 5 megapixel camera on the phone. 3. 2IC rear party says
                              the
                              video images are very good. 4. The 2IC says the images could not have been anything
                              to do
                              with nearby RAF Shawbury. 5. They show lots of
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">multi-coloured dots and zoom in on a cube shaped object which then
                                 flattens</span>. 6. The Sun has already interviewed Cpl <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> - he has explained to them
                              what he saw. 7. There is some suggestion of payment being offered - thought I think
                              a
                              discussion about that has still to happen. 8. I have reminded all, the 2IC and Cpl
                              <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> about
                              their responsibilities ref the DIN on communicating with the media. 9. Cpl <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> spoke
                              to <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> an
                              editor at The Sun (?) 10.Cpl <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> mobile number is <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> 11.I spoke to the CRO at RAF Shawbury who said he was not aware - Sqn Ldr <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span>

                              looking at the sky... there was some cloud cover just like a high fog. Athough this
                              was not dense. I could see <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">2 stars</span>, whilst i was looking at the 2 stars that i could
                              see, a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">white with a tint of orange light</span> came into view over the top of my neighbours
                              house it was traveling in a westerly but slightly south direction at a medium speed,
                              but faster than the jets that come over my house from gatwick airport. This star !
                              light ! UFO ! travelled in a perfectly straight line at the same altitude as the cloud
                              cover maybe a little higher, there was <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no sound at all completly silent</span>. I watched it
                              for as long at i could untill it dissapeared into the the cloud, and i could no longer
                              see it. I was then thinking to myself what the heck was that !! I had no explination.
                              I then was looking at the 2 stars that I was origonaily looking at... but at that
                              moment the star that was the lowest (or the furthest)
                              away from me, suddenly started moving in the same direction allthough it was not
                              taking the same path it was heading to the same point as the lst (<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">light, star, UFO</span>,)
                              this one was travelling at a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">much slower speed</span>. I also watched this one untill i
                              could see it no more at the same point as the first, This one also made <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no sound</span> and  
                              was at about the same altitude if not maybe a little higher than the 1st.... Then
                              I
                              didnt know what to do !!! I know what i saw.. so i tried to contact <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">ATC gatwick</span> they
                              gave me a phone number that is now not in use.... I then phoned <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">sussex police</span> and
                              told them what i had seen thay gave me a reference number :1907/<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">01/06/2008</span>
                              they then gave me the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">MOD UFO</span> sighting number whitch then took me te a awnsering
                              machine and i left a message. I had had no reply I know that 4 at least 4 other people
                              saw these stars UFO's lights in worthing because they called the local radio station
                              (splash FM).... 
                              I would love to hear some feedback from this.      
                              I know that we are not alone, the universe is to varst to even think that we are...
                              If
                              I can be a help or a use to you please do not hesitate to contact me... trust me i
                              
                              will not be alarmed... look forward to hearing from you.</p>

                           <p>Anyway, with reference to what I saw on my trip to Gatwick on
                              Monday
                              <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">09/01/2008</span>, here is my account of what took
                              place. I was en route to collect my neighbour's wife and children from her return
                              trip from Toronto. Her time of arrival was 11am, I was
                              advised by my neighbour that I should plan to be there about 11.30am, although I wanted
                              to
                              be a little earlier on arrival for parking and a coffee, but found myself running
                              late after
                              getting to grips with a new Satellite Navigation system and moments of slow motorway
                              traffic. At about 11.05am I was still travelling south, somewhere from the M25 to
                              the M23. I
                              would have to provide a 'guesstimate' of my rough location after tracing my route
                              and being
                              some 20-25 mlnutes away from Gatwick Airport
                              Itself and on the M23 southbound. Because I was working with a brand new Sat Nav system
                              I
                              could not immediately Identify my spot location from the map vlew (I had a Navman
                              which was
                              in a planned route mode and gave a limited vlew of where I was). But I think I was
                              on the
                              M23 not too far from the M25 junction. It was raining to some degree, I
                              had my windscreen wipers operated and car windscreen was clean and without mist with
                              car
                              air-con functional (I drive a Volvo V70). I was in the central lane paying attention
                              to
                              driving hazards and traffic progression (this being skills learnt from the Institute
                              Advanced Motorists standards and police driving standards), basically scanning from
                              horizon
                              to car bonnet and back to horizon taking into account all traffic and it's local
                              environment. times I would glance in to the sky to try to get vlew of flights in bound
                              to
                              Gatwick and an idea of my closeness to destination. It was at this point soon after
                              I saw
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">a flash and bright light in the sky</span> and Immediately associated it
                              with a plane or helicopter (where I live in Waltham Abbey gives a regular view of
                              commercial
                              type flights and helicopter flights as a Met police helicopter landing site is near
                              my house
                              about 1 mile. I walted to identify either a jet plane or helicopter. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The bright
                                 light stopped</span> and (I expected to see the plane or helicopter) allowed a side
                              profile to be viewed as <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the air-borne vehicle travelled from left to
                                 right</span>. At all times I continued to have casual peripheral vision on the
                              motorway traffic which was continuous and regular. I continued to watch the sky not
                              thinking
                              anything unusual and then this <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">oval shaped object</span> (I now realise it could
                              only match a helicopter in <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it's side profile was missing it's rear tail</span>),
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">accelerated at a colossal speed, faster than any aircraft I have or been aware
                                 of</span> accelerating before and base this on attending airshows a s a child and
                              even seelng jet fighters fly over my junlor school when a child in Loughton, Essex
                              on the
                              1970's which included the sound boom. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">This unusual oval shaped Ariel vehicle, after
                                 accelerating, just vanished out of view.</span>
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was quite small in size</span> and appeared to be below cloud cover, but I
                              cannot say categorically. Until It disappeared it was constant and visible and perhaps
                              1mile
                              away, but this is hard to say. Overall, this incident lasted for about 5- 10
                              seconds. Once it had disappeared, I had limited time to re-assess it's location
                              as my road position changed and meant I had to look to my right and through my driver's
                              door
                              window. I have not reported this to <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">MOD</span>, for a
                              limited information feedback reason, I have been aware of such matters in the past
                              as I have
                              pald casual attention to this interest since the mid 1990's (during my time in the
                              <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Met Police</span>) and relevant book releases and
                              programmes.</p>
                           <p>I would be happy to discuss this further if necessary. Regards, </p>

                           <p>DEAR SIR MADAM,</p>
                           <p>THE REPENT MIINSTRY OF BERENCE PUBUCATION OF UFO SIGNTINGS SINCE 1997 HAS
                              PROMPTED ME TO WRITE TO YOU WITH THE UFO SIGHTING, I EXPERIENCED DURING THE WAR YEARS
                              OF
                              1943/44. APART FROM CLOSE FAMLIY AND FRIENDS, I HANE NEVER OFFICIALLY
                              REPORTED THIS INCIDENT THE FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS; IN 1943/44 I WAS 15-16 YEARS
                              OLD LIVING WITH MY PARENTS IN BARKING ESSEX. I WORKED IN LONDON AND IN ORDER TO AND IN THE COMMUTER QUES FOR TRAIN TICKETS IN THE
                              MORINNG, I USED TO PURCHASE MY WORKMANS TICKET THE EVEINNG BEFORE AT BARKING
                              RAILWAY STATION, ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENINNG, WALKING FROM MY HOUSE IN
                              SOMERSY ROAD INTO SALISURY ROAD TOWARDS BARKING BEATON I SAW IN THE SKY A <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">LARGE
                                 SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT (WITH COLORED LIGHTS ALL AROUND IT’S SIDE) SPINNING AROUND AND
                                 HOVERING</span> ABOVE BARKING
                              STATION BEFORE <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">SPEEDILY FLOATING AND SPINNING AWAY IN THE
                                 DIRECTION OF BARKING PARK AND THEN DAGEINAM</span>, I WANT TO ASSUME IT TO BE
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">AROUND 300/400 FT ABOVE THE GROUND LEVEL AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FROM
                                 IT</span> FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">THE SIZE WAS AROUND 7 FEET WIDE AND 2
                                 FEET DEEP</span>. I HAVE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED THIS SIGHTING WITH BEING CONNECTED
                              TO THE WAR BUT SEEING ALL THESE PCITURES OF UFO'S, THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE REPLICA OF
                              WHAT
                              I SAW IN 1943/44. I ENCLOSE THE ARTICLE FROM THE DAILY MAIL. THE
                              ILLUSTRATION IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAW ALL THESE YEARS AGO. </p>
                           <p>YOUR COMMENTS WOULD BE APPRECIATED YOUS SINCERELY, <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> </p>

                           <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                           <p>
                              Sighting of same UFO type on two continents. I want to impress you
                              first with my qualifications for knowing what I saw and secondly for being able to
                              identify
                              that what I saw was not a normal aerial object. For some twenty five years I was in
                              the
                              <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Army of Great Britain</span> and <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Australia</span> as a National Serviceman and then as a
                              Territorial Army and Citizens' Military Force Volunteer. My final rank was Captain.
                              In the
                              <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">British Army</span>, my number was <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> and my
                              main occupation waws Forward Observer in Field Artillery but I also served in a light
                              Anti-aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery where you served by identification of
                              enemy aircraft in time to take proper action. For more than twenty-five
                              years I studied aircraft recognition as a civilian amateur and as a military
                              professional. From the foregoing I hope that you may realise that I have been
                              trained, have experience and are able to dentify objects, their shape and dimensions
                              at a
                              distance. It may be considered that if I say that I saw something and describe it
                              in detail
                              I did see it and that it did exist at two separate times in separate places on two
                              continents. Early in <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">??/??/2007</span>, I cannot give you the
                              exact date because that did not become important until my second sighting, one morning
                              I was
                              in my front garden in Hawthorn, an inner suburb of
                              Melbourne, Australia. I heard
                              a large jet aeroplane approaching from the east at low level and recognised the sound
                              of a
                              Boeing 747. I got hold of my binoculars, which I keep handy for such occasions, captured
                              the
                              image and followed the plane as it passed slowly from east to west across my front.
                              It was
                              to my north about 1,000 metres from me at as low a level as such planes are permitted
                              to fly
                              across the inner areas of Melbourne, on a line of sight
                              about fifteen degrees of elevation from me, in its sweeping approach to Tullamarine
                              airport
                              gone fifteen kilometres away. The sky was clear cloudless blue. As I
                              scanned back along the fuselage to the white kangaroo on the red tail of the Qadtas
                              jumbo I
                              saw behind and beyond the tail by at least 500 metres an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">object in the
                                 sky</span>. I recall thinking I'll follow the 747 until it goes behind the nearby
                              houses and then come back to the object. It was an <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">unusual shape</span>. The
                              other day I heard a news broadcast which mentioned the UFO desk at <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">MOD</span> in London and as a result I have
                              directed my report to you. If you require any other information, please let me know,
                              otherwise, I do not expect you to expend your valuable time on a reply. </p>
                           <p>Yours faithfully, <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>

                           <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>
                           <p>I am writing to you in regards to an unusual aerial observation that I
                              witnessed on Saturday the <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">10/20/2007</span> at 12.10 pm above my fathers home,
                              which is situated on the outskirts of Portsmouth below portsdown hill.
                              Just after midday at 12.10 pm I observed from my fathers back garden an unusual
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">oval/spherical shaped</span> object that appeared to cross the flight path of a commercial
                              aircraft, narrowly missing it, as the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">oval/spherical object</span> approached the aircraft it
                              appeared to <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">accelerate very fast</span>, in doing so it appeared to <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">wobble from side to side</span> as
                              it passed directly in front of the commercial aircraft narrowly avoiding a collision, I
                              briefly watched the object move off to the east before deciding to rush back in to
                              my
                              fathers home to retrieve my camcorder, but unfortunately when I returned to the
                              garden the object was no longer visible, (see drawing enclosed, Attachment 1!)
                              However within 2 minutes I sighted and managed to film on my camcorder another
                              object in the sky roughly in the same vicinity as the previous occurrence that I
                              couldn’t identify (see pictures enclosed, Attachment 2) the object remained virtually
                              stationary throughout the duration of 10 mimutes until it finally disappeared in to
                              the
                              clouds.
                              
                              Mr Alan Hubrecht who is a Belgium national and a “<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">NATO</span> expert in peace support
                              operations and critical infrastructure projection” wrote on my behalf to <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Airprox</span>
                              concerning this incident, <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Airprox</span> passed on the information to the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">CAA</span> (see
                              enclosed; Mr Hubrecht’s initial request to <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Airprox</span> (Attachment 3) and the <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">CAA’s</span>
                              reply back to Mr Hubrecht concerning the radar data, Attachment 4). </p>
                           <p>Mr Hubrecht has asked if he could communicate with you directly concerning this
                              incident,
                              Is this possible?
                              
                              I would be grateful for your help in this matter.

                           <p>Dear Sir</p>
                           <p>On the above heading is what I've seen, spotted over the years some I've takes photo's
                              as
                              well as videos of some from <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">06/01/2007</span> plus others in the past few weeks which I've made it public in the
                              local paper. Some of the UFO'S which you can just make their shape out, but the one
                              I took
                              in 2007 when videoed <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it took less than 6 of second to enter and disappear when it
                                 buzzed this old WWIl tempest plane</span> in the area of Dornock town and Fastriggs,
                              the other outside my back garden when I videoed an <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">RAF</span> jet circling the area several times before I went out with my camera
                              which was a cold cloudy day, when I started to video the jet at the same
                              time this <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">UFO just popped out from behind a cloud going all over the place and back
                                 into the clouds them there were others doing the same but only two of them just kept
                                 popping in and out of the clouds while the rest just stayed behind thin layers of
                                 the
                                 clouds I could just make out</span>. All the others were taken by different cameras I
                              have and one that struck me the most of all when I did not have my camera then bat
                              I
                              watched it for about 20 minutes
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was all black, no port windows, no strobe lights, no sign of where the engines
                                 were as one would on any air craft, no sound at all very quiet</span>, but underneath
                              was what struck me most of all? This UFO, would be about<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> 40/60 feet circular the
                                 height from the bottom of the UFO to the top part about 15/20</span> if no
                              more?<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> Underneath this craft had two different shaped type boxes then all the
                                 arca of it had earth military type camouflage we use on all vehicles and
                                 planes</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">it was about 500/1000feet above me and it just look like a
                                 giant Frisbe</span>e! This was August 1996 Sunday A very clear blue sky it
                              was 1:15pm, once I got home I made a model of it and made a rough birds eye
                              view of it's path as it went over the Solway cost over into England towards the East
                              coast?
                              I keep a kind of record of them so that I can keep track and numbers I've seen and
                              caught on
                              my cameras over the years. I'm not on the internet or other nets, as I can't afford
                              the cost
                              or a decent PC, had do my best with I have, though I have been interested in UFO'S
                              since my
                              school days and would like to know how far back the UK M.O,D., has known of these

                              crafts that keep popping in and out of our planet buzzing our aircrafts or just floating
                              over at a slow speed which you can pick out all the details but don't disappear or
                              change
                              shape. I had <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">two silver orbs</span> on video one taken at the solway coast and
                              above my house tie latest I got was the last week of May 2009 while photographing
                              two jets
                              going in different directions when I saw<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> 3 large spaceships</span> but managed
                              to get all on my SLR camera but 2of them when blown up <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">look like battle ships from
                                 Star Wars Film its on cunning with the shape</span> they are! To me they are the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">mother of all space crafts</span> I've ever seen. What I hope if possible,
                              of a list of' these crafts since seen and reported in our country to date plus any
                              true
                              videos/films and photos of these crafts as I would like to remake all my cuttings

                           <p>This photograph was taken by myself on <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">08/27/2006</span>, in the Trough of Bowland, Lancashire about 3 miles from Dunsop
                              Drickie traveling towards Lancaster and captured <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">something flying
                                 in the sky</span> above a grassy ridge. I was using a canon 7-million-pixel digital
                              camera. I saw the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">craft hovering for a few minutes</span> and was able to take
                              this snap. Whlist waiting for the camera to a cock itself for the next frame, <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the
                                 craft took off vertically at an amazing velocity</span>. The craft, however,
                              was unfortunately in the shadow of a cloud and cannot be seer to cast a
                              shadow. I have submitted this photograph to many newspapers and ufo
                              groups, but have only ever received one reply that said "very interesting" I
                              hope that this photo may ‘interest you'</p>

                           <p></p>
                           <p> Firstly I must stress that I am one of the world’s biggest sceptics when it come
                              to UFO’s however I can offer no realistic explanation for what I saw, therefore
                              it was literally an unidentified flying object. I was working in the air traffic control
                              at
                              RAF Lyneham in Willshire on night shift. I was the approach
                              controller and supervisor of the shirt. At the time I must have had almost 20 years
                              of
                              working on radar and was very used to analyzing the quirks which a radar can produce
                              such as
                              bird activity, ananprop (atmospheric variation) and MTI suppression. I was recovering
                              a
                              couple of C130’s to base when I saw a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">large “blob”</span> on the radar screen
                              about 3 miles from touchdown on the center line. I had no idea what it was so I called
                              it to
                              the pilots and fed them around it. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">The blob was stationary</span>. I handed the
                              aircraft over to the visual controller and then went upstairs to the visual control
                              room
                              where I could see <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the “blob”</span> on the DFTI (distance from touchdown
                              indicator). I looked through the window but couldn’t see anything, so I returned to
                              the
                              radar room. <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">Suddenly the “blob” burst and fragmented shooting off in all directions
                                 at massive speed</span>. Some discussion took place between me and the visual
                              controller and we left it at that. Sometime later I received a phone call from a very
                              agitated airman who said “Sir I have not been drinking, I am on guard duty and
                              have just seen something that was very strange, and I can’t explain but thought the
                              Air
                              traffic controller should be informed of. He said he had seen a <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright
                                 light</span> to the east I remember commenting that it was nearly Christmas but
                              doubted that we would find 3 wise men or a virgin at Lyneham. He said that the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bright light had burst and that fragments
                                 had shot in all directions at speeds which he could not believe</span>. He said he
                              had <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">never seen anything travel so fast and it was definitely not an
                                 aircraft</span>. His account caused the hairs on my neck to stand up.
                              Several minutes later another airman telephoned and gave a similar
                              account. I logged all the details and telephoned the MOD UFO desk, gave them a
                              verbal report backed up with a written report which hopefully they will still have
                              on
                              record. This happened just before Christmas but I struggle top remember the year.
                              I served
                              at Lyneham in the early to mid 90’s and I
                              guess it would be <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">12/24/1995</span>. I Think
                              the visual controller was a chap called <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> who was a Sergeant at the time because
                              I cannot
                              justify or explain it any better than I have to you. Please call me on my mobile if
                              you
                              would like to discuss it more. <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> </p>

                              hour got out of the Datsun cherry car walked around the
                              corner 3 mins away no sound listening 4 sounds because we were up to no good. Whent
                              back to
                              the car it was gone me and my 2 mates who can conferm this true story I am telling.
                              The car
                              had gone the day in back seats gone and my tent, as we were all baffled by what was
                              happening all of us in dis-belife. Where does the car go <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">no sound</span> just
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">round corner 3 mins and gone vanished</span>. Walking down a long road and
                              all 3 saw <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> I said look Boys what the fuck is that in dis-belief. I said look

                              C and in receipt of a RC service from them. He was operating around 1500ft on the

                              initially In an orbit at 80kt when the front observer saw unidentified lights flying
                              around their ac. The pilot established visual contact. He estimated 1OOm away
                              but it was very difficult to tell as he maneuvered to avoid collision and to identify
                              the light source. The lights appeared to continue to Circle their ac the same
                              height, flew to the N slightly then returned. Contact was broken by flying E to Birmingham City and descending to a lower height to
                              enable the lights to be seen against the dark sky, but the other ac
                              returned to their area. They searched the open land in the area below them with their
                              thermal camera looking for any signs of radio-controlled model activity but nothing
                              obvious
                              was found. He believes the lights may have come from a radio-controlled fixed wing

                              lights being to assist with night flying, and that it was purposely flown around them.

                              also thought that the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">intent may either have been sinister. or just someone

                              pilot of the EC135 was very co-operative and provided additional information when
                              contacted

                              operating the ac equipment and,at the time, using NVGs. All 3 crew members saw <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">2
                                 continuous (not flashing} blue/green lights</span> and the front seat observer saw an
                              object behind the lights. The rear seat observer saw the lights on his NVGs but nothing
                              else
                              due to 'blooming'. None of the crew members could offer any explanation as to the
                              source of
                              the lights other than that given by the plot. The RT recording verifies that the ECt35

                              pitot reportable the incident to Radar and they responded by saying that there were
                              no other
                              contacts in the area. The pilot discounted any 'flashing· from the rotor blades (as
                              reponed
                              as taking place In some helicopter operations In the Middle East). He also stated
                              that they
                              thought that the source of the lights might be a reflection from the NVG lenses onto
                              the
                              Inside of the ac canopy: this was later discounted alter another ac conducted a test
                              on a
                              later flight. UKAB Note (2): All available radar recordings were examined and Ille

                              inside and outside Class D airspace. The RT recording shows that the pilot was in

                              with Birmingham Radar and cleared to operate in the area. At the time the only other
                              ac seen
                              in the area and the only other In contact with radar, is a routine Birmingham CAT inbound which passes over the EC135. well
                              above. (Although he did not report seeing lt, the EC135 pilot was certain that the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights did not emanate from that ac</span>). There were several 'one swoop
                              only' primary contacts over 10nm to to W and slightly before the incident time that
                              were
                              attributed to anomalous propagation. UKAS Note (3}: Due to the pilot's report the
                              first
                              organization contacted by the UKAB in attempting to trace the source of the lights
                              was the
                              <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">British Model Flying Association</span>. Their view was
                              that the object could not have been a model ac as it would have been too high and
                              they had
                              no reports of any activity at night. In addition it would not, In their
                              view been possible to control a normal (in size and control system) model ac at that
                              height
                              since any light would not have been sufficient to enable control. In pursuing more
                              sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles, known civil, police and military operators
                              of UAVs
                              were contacted and no activity was reported (in any case it was a most unlikely)
                              location and time for the operation of UAVs, indeed virtually impossible for
                              military UAV activity). Military flights were ruled out since there was
                              no squawk observed and the area is out with the UKLFS.
                              Gliders, kites, tethered and untethered balloons were ruled out due ID the light and
                              weather conditions. There are no Met balloon launch s as in the area. All local
                              GA airfields (except Halfpenny Green) reported no night activity on the date of the
                              incident. The activity from Halfpenny Green was police operations that had landed
                              before the
                              incident time. Since the incident occurred in good radar coverage (both Birmingham
                              and
                              Ctee Hill) and no contacts either squawking or
                              primary­ only were evident within 20nm of the incident position, it Is thought most
                              unlikely
                              that the lights emanated from normal GA, other police or air ambulance activity. A
                              laser light show was also discounted since there was no cloud base for the lights
                              to be
                              reflected on. Fireworks or flares were also discounted since the light
                              source did not descend towards the ground as, even with parachute flares, would be
                              the
                              case and, in any case, the lights reported were not bright enough to be
                              pyrotechnics. The authorities for the parks close to1heincident area ware
                              contacted but they had no activity recorded for the evening of <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">06/02/1980</span>. Although the possibility of a civilian clandestine flight by a
                              microlight or similar ac could not be ruled out, it is thought unlikely that any pilot
                              engaged on illegal airborne activity would omit what could probably be identified
                              as a
                              police helicopter. Regrettably therefore, despite extensive tracing the source of the
                              lights could not be identified.  PART B: SUMMARY.OF TKEBOARD'S DISCUSSIONS
                              Information available included reports from the helicopter pilot, a recording of the
                              relevant RT frequency, radar video recordings and a report from the appropriate
                              <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">ATC</span> authorities. The Board noted the extensive
                              tracing action taken by the Secretariat and accepted that any further efforts was
                              unlikely
                              to determine the source of the lights reported by the E:C135 pilot which, despite
                              there
                              being no information to support the crew's (unanimous) sighting, Members accepted
                              totally as
                              being accurate. The Board, which Included a very experienced helicopter pilot Member
                              with

                              to
                              offer an explanation as to the source of the lights: none was forthcoming. The possibility
                              of a clandestine flight was only one of several possibilities and Members were not
                              convinced
                              that, other than by exclusion of other logical possibilities. there was _sufficient
                              information to mention this in the cause, Certainly however, the ac from which the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">lights elumanated had been small and probably non-metallic </span>since It

                           <p> Dear <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span>, </p>
                           <p> As you know, <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">OSI</span> has completed a report on the
                              <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">landing of a craft of unknown origin crewed by several entities</span> near
                              RAF Bentwaters on the night of the
                              <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold;">12/29/1980</span>. Interestingly,
                              <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">OSI</span> reports that the <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">entities were
                                 approximately 1 ½ meters tall, wearing what appeared to be nylon coated pressure suits,
                                 but no helmets</span>. Conditions on the night were misty,
                              giving the appearance that the entities were hovering above ground level. Tape recordings
                              were made on which the entities are heard to speak in an electronically synthesised
                              version
                              of English, with a strong American accent. Similar transmissions intercepted irregularly by
                              ISA(?) since 1973(see attachment- Flag 1). According to <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">OSI</span>, entities had claw-like hands and with three fingers and
                              an opposable thumb. Despite original reports(Flags 3- 0), <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">OSI</span> said <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">the craft was not damaged but landed deliberately as
                                 part of a series of visits</span> to <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">SAC</span> bases in USA and Europe. Reports that craft was repaired
                              by US serviceman or was taken on to the base are not confirmed by <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">OSI</span>. Landing is not considered a defence issue in view of the
                              overt peaceful nature of the contact, but investigations by <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> are to be
                              continued on <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> authority. Precautionary plans for counter-information at a local
                              level
                              involving <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> and <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span> is strongly recommended. </p>
                           <p>Sincerely <span class="redact">XXXXXX</span></p>
