						This project was created to collect, organize, and summarize a small
						archive of UFO reports released by the United Kingdom government in
						2013. These documents include testimonials and reports from a wide
						range of professional law enforcement/military personnel and
						civilians who had personnally witnessed an unidentified object.
					</p>
					<p>
						All source materials were collected from the UFOs section of
						<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/" target="_blank"
							>the National Archives website</a
						>. All content was available under the

							<h2><u>Our Process</u></h2>
							<ol style="text-align: start">
								<li>
									Our first step was to gather all neccessary files from
									<a
										href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/"
										target="_blank"
										>the National Archives website</a
									>.
								</li>

								<li>
									After downloading all files, we began processing each .pdf
									file. This step involved reading through each file and
									identifying the appropriate UFO reports.
								</li>
								<li>
									We then tranformed each .pdf report to a .docx file. This step
									required a great deal of manual transciptions and usage of OCR
									software available from Adobe.
								</li>
								<li>
									Once the team had all the .pdf reports transformed into .docx
									files, we were able to begin inputing the text into .xml
									files.
								</li>
								<li>
									Along with transfering the text into .xml, we started on our
									.xml mark-up proccess to identify the important information in
									each UFO Report.
								</li>
								<li>
									We gradually continued marking-up our .xml files while we
									began development on our user interface.
								</li>
								<li>
									The team completed all .xml mark-up and this is where we
									implimented our .xslt procedures to create our .html pages.
								</li>
								<li>
									Our last step was refining the .xml mark-up and the layout of
									our .html pages.
								</li>
								<li>
									Not long after that we had what you are looking at today!
