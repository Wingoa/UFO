						<p>
							This project was created to collect, organize, and summarize a
							small archive of UFO reports released by the United Kingdom
							government in 2013. These documents include testimonials and
							reports from a wide range of professional law enforcement/military
							personnel and civilians who had personally witnessed an
							unidentified object.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							All source materials were collected from the UFOs section of
							<a

								target="_blank"
								>the National Archives website</a
							>. All content was available under the

								<h2><u>Our Process</u></h2>
								<ol style="text-align: start">
									<li>
										Our first step was to gather all neccessary files from
										<a
											href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/"
											target="_blank"
											>the National Archives website</a
										>.
									</li>

									<li>
										After downloading all files, we began processing each .pdf
										file. This step involved reading through each file and
										identifying the appropriate UFO reports.
									</li>
									<li>
										We then tranformed each .pdf report to a .docx file. This
										step required a great deal of manual transciptions and usage
										of OCR software available from Adobe.
									</li>
									<li>
										Once the team had all the .pdf reports transformed into
										.docx files, we were able to begin inputing the text into
										.xml files.
									</li>
									<li>
										Along with transfering the text into .xml, we started on our
										.xml mark-up proccess to identify the important information
										in each UFO Report.
									</li>
									<li>
										We gradually continued marking-up our .xml files while we
										began development on our user interface.
									</li>
									<li>
										Our xml mark-up began with us identifying what information
										appeared to be standard throughout each UFO Report. These
										elements inlcuded dates, locations, organizations,
										enviromental conditions, key notes, and of course UFO
										descriptions.
									</li>
									<li>
										At this point, we created a standardized schema that we
										could import into each xml file.
									</li>
									<li>
										Along with the xml work, we began creating our charts and
										tables based on the information that we had so far. This
										included our xsl style sheets that we used for the report
										tables and the bar graphs on the statistics page.
									</li>
									<li>
										The team completed all .xml mark-up and this is where we
										implimented our .xslt procedures to create our .html pages.
									</li>
									<li>
										One of our last steps was refining the .xml mark-up and the
										layout of our .html pages, charts, and report tables.
									</li>
									<li>
										Then some final tweaks on the user interface. This was most
										changing the layout of some pages and adding to the global
										.css file.
									</li>
									<li>
										Not long after that we had what you are looking at today!
									</li>
								</ol>
								<br />
								<p>
									There is still a great deal that could be added to the site.
									The UFO map could include direct url's to the cordinating
									report. There are still is a large number of reports that
									could be processed and added to the site. If someone was
									interested in doing this, all of the reports still exist on
									<a
										href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/"
										target="_blank"
										>the National Archives website</a
									>. There are many reports that are simple and do not contain
									as much open text as the ones that we used. Listed below is an
									example of one of those reports. There are approximately 50 -
									80 of these reports included with the National Archives
									collection. Could be a fun idea if you need a new project!
